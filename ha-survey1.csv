"9",9,"4/22/2015 16:57:43","United Kingdom","Discussions online.","Sometimes","Mostly","I don't recall seeing Hugo Award on UK book covers, whereas I have seen Clarke award listed on book covers, this is v imprecise. Books don't necessarily come out at the same time in UK/Commonwealth and US, and I don't know how that affects eligibility. The conventions that nominate and vote on the awards are mostly hosted in North America. That it's an English language award means it's got an Anglophone focus and the US is the most powerful Anglophone country, especially when it comes to cultural export. While these things don't equal US dominance they do skew things. I think that the influence of the Internet has lead to more cross-pollination, awareness of works from other places, but equally it means US works/fandom can spread further.","Not sure. In some years that may be the case, but I don't feel very qualified to comment on such trends. This year it doesn't.","I think it reflects a specific part of fandom, and this may change in different years (especially if the convention is outside North America). I don't think it reflects broader fandom, I think there are huge swathes of fandom not represented by the Hugo, though they may have no need for/interest in it.","Not sure. Fandom is pretty diverse in UK, and there are definitely some who do value the Hugo, but I suspect there are plenty of others who feel unconnected to it.","Factioning seems deeply unhelpful, especially when so vitriolic. The puppies are certainly not in the right here and the worst of them are being actively harmful. That said, although I agree far more with their opponents I don't think they have any more right to game the awards or use block voting. I don't know if that's actually happened, and if it did I don't think those people would wish to be harmful, but I'm aware that my own politics would cause me to be more sympathetic to such campaigns.
I think there are people who represent certain parts of fandom, and the puppies represent some just as their opponents represent others. It would be hard to find a single institution to encompass the broadened base of fandom, and the Hugos can only represent a part, I guess the question is which part will they come to represent?","Yes, I know little about art but I do like fiction and podcasts. I don't feel certain about best related work or editors or zines.","Clarke award - I have more awareness of who it's named after and it is positioned as UK-based, but not UK exclusive, award.
BSFA awards - similar to above, i've been eligible to vote a few times and though it isn't a large award it feels like it is for a particular community.
BSF awards - same as above, though perhaps even smaller. Though there was a controversy some years ago (which I witnessed) that led to an overhaul in its organisation. Since then I have been on a jury for the award, so I could be biased in its favour.","","",""

It was the year that Among Others got nominated (2012).","Yes","Yes","Very few magazines or editors from anywhere else ever get nominated, and books released here first rarely appear (i.e. Lagoon was published in the UK first, even if the author is American). The Hugos are tied to WorldCon, and WorldCon is rarely anything but American. Even when it's held elsewhere -- with a few exceptions there wasn't a huge shift to UK nominations last year. If it makes it to Helsinki, I doubt the ballot will be flooded with Finnish SF. There are just so many more Americans nominating that anyone else will get drowned out.","I feel they represent the most popular works, or at least those which most people agree they like, usually published in the US. In the novel category at least, the nominations are rarely surprising. I would really like to see a larger ballot in the fiction categories for that reason. 

The other categories reflect wider fandom as I see it. Fandom, as I see it, is predominantly American.","The ones I interact with, yes. ","I know very few sf fans in my area and those I do know are predominantly TV and film fans, not literature. I honestly doubt they know what the Hugo is. I have discussed the awards with people in the same country as me only once, at LonCon. I have one friend who reads Gail Carriger and one who reads Naomi Novik, a couple more who read Game of Thrones, and that is it. None of those people live anywhere near me these days.","I haven't read any of their works and, after last year, don't intend to. Even those I've heard of are on the outer edges of my radar. People like KJA and Jim Butcher have never appealed to me. It's like they write in a whole different genre to the one I'm familiar with. I've decided the SP/RP people just haven't come to terms with the world of social media. In the modern world, books are talked about in a more visible manner and it's easy to see, on the internet, which ones are going to end up on the ballot. That isn't a slate. It's just conversation. In the ""good old days"" it was impossible to hear all those voices repeating the names of the books over and over until those books appeared on the ballot. But I'm pretty sure the conversation was still there.

I'm taking a ""No Award"" to the slate approach. Even in DP Long Form - not like Hollywood's going to care if they lose a Hugo. I may not even bother with that category. I enjoy very few films these days.","Fancast - last year everything I nominated in this category got onto the ballot and this is the category for which I feel the widest ""read"". I was really surprised this year by which nominees managed to cling on and which got pushed off by the slate. It really polarised.

I'm quite interested in the short story category, from a writing perspective because I want to see what's resonating with people and where those works are being published. ","The Tiptree Award often comes up with works I haven't heard much about or which are doing something interesting. Also The Kitschies.

I would say that before the Sad/Rabid Puppies thing most of my peer group wouldn't have known what the Hugos were, or how they were voted for.","I think it's an essential weakness of popularity-based awards that they can be gamed this way.

The fact that the puppies feel so unable to judge works from people who think differently to them and tell stories from that worldview that they are compelled to overrun the Hugos and try to bully fandom into such a narrow channel is saddening.

I do not have precise figures available to hand (it is late and I am tired), but I suspect more citizens of the United States of America (not the Americas) have won the Hugo Award than non-Americans, which would suggest to me that given the size of the USAs population in relation to the rest of the world in the last 75 years as an award for the World Science Fiction Convention is disproportionate. 

Also Worldcon is held more often in the United States with the nationality generally most represented being citizens of the USA. This drastically affects the nominations and voting. 

However, this is part of the award's character. Efforts to make it a genuinely world award are nice, but I suspect really for there to be an award that's representative and inclusive of all people then another serious award needs to be created which replaces the Hugo Award and has a less awful set of rules which bias the voting constituency against fiction that's not written both in the English language and published by publishing houses in the USA.","Sort of.

So no, I don't think the puppies represent fandom as I see it, but they do represent their malignant festering tumorous part of fandom.  ","I want to like the short fiction categories more, but am always disappointed.(That's me taking life lessons from Ballard & Harrison there.)

The fan write category is important because it can directly rewards critics who I believe are the vitally important to the health of the field and help drive sf/f's progress.","No really. The BSFA and Clarke awards are nominally more British so have a local relevance for me. ","I would be interested in more regional identities being expressed in sf/f generally. At the moment we talk about being inclusive as involving bringing people into the conversation from different ethnicities and countries. As someone who is both from Europe and the United Kingdom, and has lived in other European countries and has cousins who are French, I am acutely aware that part of my identity is being erased when as a native English speaker my fiction and perspective is grouped with those perspectives from the United States of America, but also, sometimes, from the United Kingdom or England as a whole. And I really certain that we are all guilty of erasing people's identities when we say they are from Germany or America or China because someone who is from Berlin, New York, or Beijing does not share the same identity as someone who is from Munich, San Francisco or Hong Kong.

Personally, I am from the United Kingdom of Graham Joyce and Some Kind of Fairytale and not the United Kingdom of Charles Stross' Edinburgh. The societies we live in are the same nation with many similarities, but also lots of subtly differences which are what add character to our lives. 

It is utterly wrong to do this and we are harming ourselves by not diving into the interesting specifics. It's these differences which the puppies fear. It's the lack of a certain all encompassing identity which we must resist. I am like you, but I am also different from you in some ways, and that's awesome.","",""

I write fanfiction, and blog in fandom, and it feels like the fan writing category is more about giving legitimacy to ""real"" SFF fandom from acceptable authors, than it is about celebrating fan participation, fan journalism, and fandom in general.

Does the voting population reflect the SF/F readership at large? No, probably not. Is that a problem? Not really, that readership has Goodreads and other such outlets.

I think sampling from World Con is inevitably going to lead towards skewing - generally tending towards the wealthy and conservative - something of an Old Guard. Although until this year I had thought that was changing to reflect the rest of fandom more. To be honest, I have always felt that the way voting depends on wealth - the wealth to buy tickets or supporting memberships - is deeply problematic. I have never been able to vote or nominate as a consequence, and this is true of most people I know under 40.

As has been effectively underlined this year: you can buy votes. That's pretty awful. It's only been a kind of honour code that has prevented it being skewed this way before.","More or less. I think authors and editors have a vested interest in supporting the Hugos and generally have wealth enough that voting isn't a problem. Because they don't think of themselves as wealthy, it's easy for them to overlook the issue. I think people have generally been in favour of the Hugos becoming more diverse, but there's a lack of awareness about how wealth, age, and geography play into the character of who gets to nominate and vote.","SP/RP categorically do not represent fandom. They represent the most toxic end of a small right-wing section of fandom who are so unaware of their own privilege that they perceive any attempt to address the imbalances that exist as an attack, completely oblivious to how they have consistently benefitted from the gentler conservative prejudices of the old guard.

It's disgusting how they have behaved. It's a concerted effort to break the Hugos because they feel threatened by moves towards progress.

Modern fandom is a diverse, lively, and welcoming community which is about enjoying works with whole hearts. I don't recognise anything I would call 'fandom' in the toxic, exclusionary, aggressive attitudes of teh so-called 'puppies'.","I find this a weird question. So I guess 'no'. I think growing up I cared more about the book categories because I was only aware of them. Now, as someone who engages with fandom broadly and across technology, I find all of them interesting. As a writer who has mostly only been elligible for nomination for 'Best Related Work', I'll admit to caring more about that in recent years, especially after a collection I was in was nominated for it, but I'm not sure I would say that makes me 'drawn' to the category. I'm interested in criticism, critique, and interpretation of the culture I enjoy, so that category is important to me. But so are the others. I have no idea if this at all relates to what you wanted. I find the question too vague. ","I suppose the British Fantasy Society Awards. It's much easier for me to take part in them and they showed significant progressive tendencies last year. However, I have generally found most awards to be skewed towards the conservative. Recent changes, as we have seen, are open to fluctuation.

The Nebulas, also, seem more 'with the times' - more diverse and inclusive.

Probably more than anything else, the Kitschies reflect both the fun, the diversity, and the literary sensitivities that interest me.","I'm not sure that the main problem with the Hugos is georgaphical, which I take to be the main point of this survey. But there is a problem with encouraging an 'in crowd' to be considered, given how the Hugo votes are drawn, and the whole idea of a 'supporting membership' does not broaden this, but makes the Hugos particularly open to abuse by those with money and a bitter resentment of any but themselves enjoying fandom.

I've also seen more liberal people offering to buy supporting memberships for others to 'balance it out', but it seems to me this just underscores how fundamentally corrupt the whole Hugo voting model is. The rich vote. They will always tend to be older and more conservative.","",""

b) The Hugo Award is an award for works in English, and the US is the biggest English-speaking country. Of course it's not very relevant for e.g. Swedish literature -- very little Swedish fantasy or science fiction is ever translated into English. In the odd case when a Swedish writer write in English, for an American publication, with a primarily American audience in mind, that is, to me, not Swedish literature, but American literature that happens to be written by someone from Sweden. No international award could take into account works in only one language. The Hugo is for works in English, and that's fine. It will never be very relevant internationally. That's not really a problem.","The Hugo Awards have no ambition to reflect science fiction and fantasy as I see it. I read in several languages and the Hugo Awards are for works in English. There is absolutely no point to pretend to have a truly international award which takes only English works into account, and a sort of cultural colonialism to expect translations into English to be a priority for writers in other languages. 

With that said, and looking only at the world of English science fiction and fantasy, no, the Hugo Awards tend to skew towards populism. Be well liked, be known within fandom, and something you wrote will much easier be nominated. See Neil Gaiman, who will see his works nominated whether they deserve it or not, or John Scalzi, who will see his works nominated although they very rarely deserve it, which is probably at least partly due to the popularity of Whatever.","Of course not. It's an award given out by the members of Worldcon. It has never pretended to reflect the entire science fiction and fantasy fandom. If it did, the awards would probably be even more useless. This is not a bad thing. And yet again, it's an award of the English-speaking world. Of course it's dominated by people who speak English as their native language.","Some of them, sure. Pretty much everything I've written I've heard someone else say at least once.","No. They represent a fraction of (mainly) US fandom.

As does Worlcon members. But yet again, this is not ""fandom's big award."" It's an award given out by the members of Worldcon. Which is fine.","The fan award categories are the only categories I can take seriously.","Yes, even if we keep to just the English-speaking world. Both the Tiptree Award and the Arthur C. Clarke Award both tend to award better literature. Probably because they're juried awards. Crowds are very bad at giving out awards to interesting works of fiction.","It's a bit unclear whether you talk about English-speaking fandom, or international fandom. The potential answers to some of these questions would be vastly different depending on which alternative you mean.","",""

The two editor categories are harder to get a good idea for (and would require much much more reading to do so). Fan writer can also be a bit foreign if you haven't heard of any of them before. I think the dramatic presentations are silly insofar as no one in Hollywood gives a crap, but whatever.","As an Australian, I find the Australian awards more relevant to me personally. In large part because there is a much greater chance a priori for me to be familiar with the work nominated/shortlisted. The Ditmar (fan voted) and Aurealis (juried) Awards in particular.

I think this will change more and more as years go by.","For everything not the Novel category I would say yes. I think there are definitely popular novels, and novels I personally enjoy, that I would expect to rarely if ever be nominated and to be even less likely to win. That said, I enjoy many of the novels that do win/get nominated and find they almost always are examples of the pinnacle of the sf/f writing craft. ","No, I wouldn't expect that they are. They are a small collection of fans very committed to the genre and the discussions of genre. I expect they are similar to critics and reviewers (of which many probably are) in that they have likely read more, read more and will read more of the field than your average fan. I also suspect they are more familiar with writers and their careers than your average fan. I also think they are more likely to be interested in new, cutting edge, or more ""literary"" SF/F.","I really have no idea.","Fandom as in the people at and running the cons? I'd suspect the opponents of the SP/RP groups to be more representative. However, I do believe there are many SF/F fans represented by the SPs. (The RPs are, near as I can tell, fans of nothing other than themselves as reactionary shit-disturbers). I do think the SPs have a couple of valid points buried in their arguments, but I am very much not a fan of how the comport themselves. I also think that whatever good points they might have get lost in their whiny, childish, paranoid, right-wing conspiracy driven rhetoric.","I don't tend to read enough novellas and novellettes, so those categories interest me less. I love short stories so that category along with short form editor and the short-form market awards interest me. The category for graphic novels/comics is a big one for me. The Dramatic presentation categorys seems largely pointless to me as they tend to be won by things that don't give a damn about the hugos nor benefit from their wins. The Fan Writer and Podcast categories are ones I don't often feel comfortable nominating in but I'm often interested in checking out what gets nominated there. Ditto for best related work. Best Novel remains the most interesting and important category in my opinion. Though it might be changing as shorter forms slowly regain some market share in the internet age the Novel remains THE primary format for SF/F. It's the equivalent of the Oscars Best Picture. It's the one award everyone wants to know who won.","More relevant? I'm not sure if I'd say they are more relevant, but I'm very interested in the Nebulas and the World Fantasy Awards.

Ian M Banks (RIP), Alastair Reynolds, Neal Asher, William Gibson, Andy Wier, Peter F Hamilton - people who you see in the SF section of the shelves of airport bookshops are rarely (if ever) nominated. Instead next year there will be another Vorkosigan novel on the shortlist, because god forbid that Lois McMaster Bujold not be nominated.","I love my friends who go to worldcon, but I'm middle aged and these people are all OLDER than me. Worldcon needs to be held in places like Singapore or Kuala Lumpur or Dubai - places with stacks of fans, rather than bouncing between the US, UK and sometimes Australia or Canada.","I think the puppy stuff is crap, but I think it's a symptom of how far the Hugos have drifted from what people more generally are reading.

Neither do the current lot who have a deathgrip on the Hugos. Anyone who is a centrist is fed up with both lots. Scalzi's fricking avatar is a guy with a huge mallet. How he considers himself a conciliatory centrist is beyond a lot of people.","Novels mostly. I think it says a lot about the Hugos that there is nothing around computer games. The Mass Effect trilogy was SF played across a huge canvass by tens of millions of people. More people probably interact with SF through computer games than through books or comics. But no Hugo love. (though again not surprising given that many worldconners aren't exactly up-to-date tech wise - and certainly aren't living a very digital lifestyle)","","The Sad Puppy shit was an inevitable reaction to what's been going on in the awards. Winners who have written mediocre novels winning awards when astoundingly great works (some of which have been bestsellers) haven't even gotten on the ballot. What's most likely to happen is that the current crop of winners will fend off the puppy people. And for the next decade the award will keep being handed between the same few people with a rare breakout novel gaining attention if it shares the same political bent. There's a thing you can look up called ""Group Polarization"" which explains how groups end up (a) becoming more extreme and (b) becoming more homogenous in their philosophies. That's what happened to worldcon (and the Hugos) - it got stagnant and pleased with itself - the people doing really interesting and weird and exciting stuff (how the heck did Quantum Thief not end up on the ballot in its year, or Lexicon) - doesn't even show up on the radar for a cohort that is more interested in doddering about awarding the same writers for writing slight variations of the same novels that won awards in the past.","",""

Certainly with friends who share my interest in SF most feel that nominated novels in recent years do not seem to reflect books they actually enjoy. Knowing I voted in the Hugos, several people asked my why Andy Weir's The Martian wasn't in. (Yes, not first year of distribution)

Others are sympathetic to what I perceive as likely a 'puppy' argument that current winners are tending to be more esoteric and stylistic in nature.

But this is tricky because it's anecdotal and I'm hesitant to draw too much in the way of conclusions from it. I am sure other people have radically different friends and consequently radicaly different experiences from mine.","A giant mess. Sad Puppies has had some positives; it has convinced me that the Hugos are extremely ethically and sincerely run. It has also convinced me that far too small a number -- including this year the Puppies themselves -- are voting to nominate our field's most prestigious award. 

Neither represents fandom; each only a portion in my view. The average age of WorldCon attendees is getting older and older, and many of the choices (including those of the puppies) seem at best idiosyncratic.

It is also worth noting that the far more 'extreme' Rabid Puppies slate generally beat out the more moderate Sad Puppies slate. This does note bode well, at least for 2015 and certainly contributes to the feeling of a mess.

I was sad to see Marko Kloos withdraw (presumably under pressure), but delighted to see the 3-Body Problem appear. This tilts the Hugos slightly away from being 'all-American' and it is a very fine novel.","Definitely; the ones I'm most familiar with -- dramatic presentation short and long form, best novel, best novella.

","Sometimes","Mostly","The 'World' in 'Worldcon' and 'World SF Society' is a misnomer. Or, rather, the meaning of that 'World' has shifted, and is still shifting, and is anyway viewed differently by different  people simultaneously. 

The first Worldcon was so named because it took place in New York, in 1939, and New York was simultaneously hosting the World's Fair. There was, so far as I know, no association between the two.

I presume though there was some notion of bringing the world of science fiction to New York's sf fans, and this developed into a convention that moved around the US, providing people with a chance to meet authors and one another. It seems like a very innocent endeavour, and I can imagine for them the world was North America and its developing fan groups, with some activity in the UK and no real idea what went on elsewhere. While they were doubtless shaped in part by an infant ideology of if it doesn't happen here, it doesn't happen anywhere else, they weren't really in a position to test that theory.(At some point someone needs to do a serious study of the effects of World War II on fan attitudes – not a history of who was where when but a proper sociohistorical study with grown-up theory in it.)

So,initially, 'world' does not mean world. At least, not like that. There are occasional forays beyond the North American continent (London, Heidelberg, Melbourne) but there's a sense that this is a treat for overseas fans, taking the show abroad once in a while. By the time I came along, there was a complex bid-zoning system for where in the US the convention could go by rotation, and when overseas bids could be submitted, and NASFICs for the years when the convention left North America (much of the zoning stuff seems to have died a death, presumably thanks to cheaper flights across the US). So it's clearly been positioned as a North American convention that goes abroad occasionally, not as a 'world', that is global, convention.

It is only comparatively recently that the emphasis on 'world' as 'global' has arisen, which I attribute to the many, many changes in the way the sf community perceives itself, its ability to keep in touch with people, different attitudes towards sf, all the stuff that's been rehearsed a hundred times across blogs and social media. And I think this is a very good thing. 

But only this week I've talked to people who thought that 'world' always meant 'global' and hadn't realised how the convention was originally named, which has clarified my puzzlement about their puzzlement.

What does this have to do with the Hugos?

The Hugos began as a one-off award given by one Worldcon. The following year's Worldcon didn't give them, but then Worldcons started to do it regularly and the association between the two became a legal one.To be a Worldcon, one of the things a convention must do is to agree to host and administer the Hugos. They were originally called Annual Science Fiction Achievement Awards until they officially became the Hugos. I suppose we might argue that they honoured the world of sf insofar as the voters understood it, which was a world in which sf was published in the US by mostly white men and some women. In other words, like most awards, they honoured the community  which gave them, and this supposed that there was one community. (I doubt there ever really was but like all dysfunctional communities they pull together for the year's big celebration.)

Worldcons have got bigger, as more people read sf and fantasy, and more people read a broader range of sf and fantasy, and critically, more people outside the Anglo-American axis read and write sf, but because the convention has been primarily tied to North America, I'm not sure these huge shifts in demographic have necessarily been reflected as immediately in Hugo nominating/voting patterns as it ought to have been. Indeed, it's been notoriously difficult to get an English novel or piece of non-fiction that isn't a zine onto a ballot. 

In part that would be because North Americans couldn't get hold of the UK material easily (whatever we might feel about Amazon et al it's amazingly easy to get a text these days) but equally, because it was incredibly difficult and expensive to send money abroad. International money orders were very expensive, very few UK people had US checking accounts, and credit cards had barely been invented, and weren't available to many ordinary people in the UK. I'm sure this is part of the reason why there has traditionally been a UK book blip in nominating patterns the year after a UK worldcon, because people had the power to nominate, and had been able to buy a voting membership too without having to deal with currency exchange (though Worldcons did, of course, eventually begin to have some foreign agents to deal with that – it would be interesting to see what the take-up was for that before the internet made everything easier). 

But even now, there have been recent years when I was just too broke to afford £25 to buy a supporting membership to vote (or maybe I didn't care enough to starve – who knows :-) ) And I'm probably not the only one. 

And in that the Hugo Awards reside within the Worldcon, which is still primarily a convention for North American fans, yes, I think it is primarily an American award. I'm not sure it intends to be, but if the award administration resides within a convention that is primarily a US convention, and is, or has been, primarily voted on by USians, with no mechanism for outreach, how can it be anything but primarily an American award? And to describe itself now as a 'world' award seems more risible than it did forty or fifty years ago, when it pretty much was. ","Not really. Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't. Popular votes are about popular books. Popular doesn't necessarily mean well-written  but it does mean that people like the book or its author, or both. I don't like a lot of popular sf or fantasy because it's literally generic, often badly written, and is just not my thing. It's frustrating but I live with it, and I don't feel any particular desire to tear down the fabric of society because I can't get my own way. But sometimes we all agree, and that's nice. ","That is a tricky question because Hugo Award voters may or may not be a sub-set of Worldcon members, and they may or may not be actual Worldcon attendees, and that's a whole different subset of people. And what is fandom anyway? 

There are some people who would argue that because I rarely go to Worldcon I am not a fan, not a proper fan. Indeed, because I rarely go to conventions now, I'm not a proper fan. Others would argue that because I don't produce a fanzine, about fans, I'm not a proper fan. (Though when I did, I still wasn't a proper fan; see reasons above.)  For sure, there have been people who think that because I write about books in a more academic way, I'm not a proper fan. And if those are the criteria, I'm fairly sure I'm not a proper fan, and happy not to be so.

But if by fan we mean people who love sf and fantasy in their diverse forms, talk about it, etc, in public, then yes, I'm a fan, though my participation in 'fandom' is mainly in social media and literary arenas.

But it's almost impossible to know who Hugo voters are, except through what they nominate and vote on. I think it would be fair to say that most Hugo *voters* rarely share my taste in sf and fantasy but a fair number of *nominators* might share some of my tastes. And I have many good friends with appalling taste in books.","Define 'area'? Geographically, I have no idea as I don't have much contact with fans face-to-face on a regular basis. The places where I participate online? I think a fair number would share my opinion, but I can't speak for the lurkers. ","They don't represent the fans I know best, but those I know best tend to be progressives rather than conservatives, so there is that to start with.

Then we need to separate Sad Puppies from the Rabid Puppies. 

The Sad Puppies seem to me to represent a group of mainly men who hanker after the lost golden age of twelve in a Ray Bradbury novel, when they were the centres of their own personal universes, and sex, work, and people not adoring their awesomeness was not an issue. They seem to be drawn to every marker of masculinity you can think of so I imagine the modern world must come as something of a shock to them. Particularly the bits about being called out for the way they refer to women, homosexuals, other ethnicities, and pretty much anyone who isn't a white cishet gun-toting man's man like them. 

(Excuse my sarscasm. Actually, don't.)

But there are Sad Puppies and Sad Puppies, i.e the people who the Sad  Puppies have determined share their values because their fiction implies they might do.  So, on top of all their other crimes, there is a failure to distinguish fiction from real life,and to separate author from text.

More seriously, I think the actual Sad Puppies seem to be symptomatic of a broader social movement of men who have discovered that the world doesn't revolve round them and are not very good at figuring out why this might be and how best to deal with it,and can't shut up about how much it hurts. They're all 'I could have been a contender', or that difficult uncle who turns up at Christmas to whine about not having had the breaks, and haven't noticed that if they cleaned up their acts, they still could be contenders, though I still wouldn't vote for the kind of stuff they write because it's dull and old-fashioned. But lots of people do like what they write; they just liked what someone else wrote better when Correia didn't win the Campbell. This is the big problem. They're dealing in absolutes (because they're twelve) rather than in gradations, like grown-ups. 

The Rabid Puppies – and here I mean Theodore Beale and, yes, John C Wright, because I regard him as much more dangerous than the likes of Correia and Torgerson – are a whole different thing. Beale is utterly detestable but much more politically savvy than the likes of LC and BT (as witnessed by their getting him involved in the first place). And much the same could be said of JCW.

The Sad Puppies sort of emerge from a line of jolly fannish japes, like buying a voting membership for your pet rock, even though they were hamfisted in trying to turn the Hugos back to real fiction by real men (i.e.the stuff they write) but the RPs seem to me to be simply using the Hugos as but one more arena for a much more fundamental disagreement with society about their position, or lack of position, in it. It is really all about white male supremacy, and the Hugos just turn out to be collateral damage this year, and probably in years to come.

In many respects, the biggest problem the sf community has got is that it is trying to Save the Hugos when it could be using its considerable energy to campaign about things like black teenagers getting shot, the erosion of women's reproductive rights, diversity issues, combatting the MRA movement, and using sf texts to illustrate their arguments rather than trying to preserve the non-existent sanctity of an award because  … tradition. 

This is not to say that many fine people do not devote time to these issues as well as trying to Save the Hugos, but the Hugos are not going to be saved like that. They've lost their innocence, insofar as they ever had any (which is of course the point the SPs were in their cackhanded fashion making, and they were up to a point correct) so better to think about what to do in future, bearing in mind the ridiculous restrictions round trying to make any changes, and stop fretting about reclothing the Hugos in virginal white. 

Having said that, the Save the Hugos faction does indeed represent the kind of fandom I know. Very well-meaning, sometimes almost child-like in its desire to do the right thing, heavily vested in its history and traditions, basically good-hearted but sometimes very unworldly. And unfortunately, the world has come to them.

I can't imagine that we'll ever be able to go back to the happy, prelapsarian world where people good-naturedly campaigned for their mates and David Gerrold could win a Hugo for a frankly execrable story because it was all about his adopted son and … ah!!!

In a way, I'm not sure I want to. On the other hand, I can see that for many people it's a hell of a shock to move from that to something akin to neo-Nazis demanding you vote for a slate that has been carefully selected for its literary purity, with nothing in between. 

I doubt I am the only British observer who seems a certain similarity between the SPs and UKIP and the RPs and the British National Party and the English Democratic League and all the other far-right splinter groups we have. ","Yes. I am always more interested in the text-based categories, fiction and, sometimes best related. I'm more interested recently in fanzine/fan writer because of the way it's shifted from the same old names churning out the same old fan history in paper zines to people writing online about fandom now (though having said that I shall happily nominate Mike Glyer for fan writer for his exemplary journalism on the Sad Puppies case, because he has truly done good work that deserves to be recognised). 

I would like to see the fiction categories streamlined, to something like long and short form, but can't imagine I will live long enough given the speed at which the process moves. 

I'd still like to see something address critical writing, review, commentary more effectively than brw/best fan writer tries to, but I know I have a vested interest, and I also know it would also just make the whole thing far more complicated than it already is. (Having said that, I also know that there is a peculiar little gap between popular and peer-reviewed academic that isn't fully addressed except by the Atheling award, and that's only for Australians.)","BSFA Award – tends to reflect my own reading interests more

(Personally I think that Worldcon shouldn't be allowed to be in the same country two years in a row as well as the rxisting 500 mile rule).
","complicated.

Since becoming aware of the Hugos, they in part form my view of SF/F.

If authors I think are good get nominated, it vindicates my belief that I'm reading good stuff. Ditto if TV/films I enjoy are nominated it's nice to see that.

Don't really pay attention to the fan categories as they're not my thing.","I think it reflects a fan sufficiently dedicated enough to bother voting in the hugos. Doubly so if they buy supporting membership of worldcon just for voting without being able to attend.

Think this reflects a certain hardcore of fandom, but doesn't represent the majority.","No idea","Based on what I've read about the SP/RP slate based voting, it's an exploitation of the weaknesses in the current hugo nomination mechanisms. Based on what I've read about the originators of the slate, I'm opposed to their agenda, and think measures should be taken to prevent their abuse of the system.

These people do not represent fandom as I see and experience it, but maybe I experience a certain brand of leftie permissive fandom...

I think the SP/RP slate has betrayed the sense of fair play that previously permeated the process. It was ""Not the done thing"" to form a slate (apparently it's only recently become acceptable to provide a list of your own works so people know what they can nominate you for). In the future Slates and opposing slates will probably become the norm unless you can change the rules to restrict them.","Dramatic presentation short and long form are probably the ones I'm most likely to be interested in, I don't read enough new stuff on a wide enough range to form an opinion about all possible nominations, but do watch a lot of telly and some films.","no","having a random idea wherein national science fiction conventions get a small block of nominations/votes which can be submitted to the hugos.

These could be voted on by the membership of that national convention (e.g. eastercon in the UK) and allow those who attend that convention but not worldcon to have some input into the hugos.

Probably a complete pain in the ass to implement and in many ways possibly worse than the current system, but might help make things a bit more global.","",""

"117",117,"4/23/2015 7:45:37","United Kingdom","I first heard about them on the covers of novels which said ""Hugo award winning author"", I think.

","Sometimes","Mostly","","Many of the Hugo Award categories are for types of work (or people) that I really know nothing about, and am not that interested in. 

Of the categories that do mean something to me, the nominations for Dramatic Presentation (Long & Short) and Graphic Story do seem relevant. Best Related Work sometimes seems to include very arcane items (e.g. albums of sf folk music) but is mostly fine by me. 

The Best Novel nominations often strike me as a bit odd, not because the works nominated are insufficiently popular with a mass audience but because their presence on the ballot frequently seems to have more to do with the enthusiasms and loyalties of the various factions within Worldcon fandom than with what I would regard as literary quality. There's generally at least one or two books on the ballot which I'd say were ""Hugo worthy"", though - I'm just not convinced that they really represent a sampling of the ""best of the field"".

","No.

Sf and fantasy fandom is a very broad church these days, made up of many sub factions, and people who regularly go to Worldcon strike me as their own subgroup which is not particularly representative of ""sf and fantasy enthusiasts"" as a whole. 
","I think most sf fans I know, and most people within the UK who are sf and fantasy enthusiasts, would share a lot of the opinions I've expressed here.

People who regularly go to Eastercon and other ""traditional sf cons"" in the UK are probably more in tune with the Hugos, more likely to have at least heard of the nominees in categories like Best Fancast or Best Editor, and so on.
","Neither side represents fandom as I see it.

I believe that the Hugos, while always political, have become increasingly factionalised recently. This might be to do with the internet, which makes it easier for people to become aligned with a group and only read or nominate works on the recommended reading lists of their own faction. Slate voting, however, represents another escalation of factionalism, and I disapprove of it on principle.

","To be honest, most of the categories strike me as more important to ""traditional sf convention fandom"" than to me, or to most people interested in science fiction and fantasy. Which is entirely reasonable, given that the Hugos are awarded by Worldcon members, but does mean that I'm really not that concerned about most of the categories.

So what do I care about? Best Novel, Best Dramatic Presentation (Long & Short Forms), Best Graphic Story and Best Related Work. 

In theory I should also be interested in the best short story / novella / novelette categories, but in practice I don't read new short fiction apart from the occasional single author collection, and neither does anyone else I see regularly, so these awards are pretty much irrelevant to me.


","The Clarke Award, which is chosen by a jury who have actually read most of the works which might theoretically be eligible in a given year and is thus less prone to factional voting and identity politics.

The Kitschies, which seem much more open to new forms (meaning the ""Invisible Tentacle"" for natively digital fiction).
","Personally, I feel that the lack of a Hugo Award for ""best game"" makes the Hugos look very out of touch with sf and fantasy as a whole. Imagine that in 1980 there were no awards for Best Dramatic Presentation because most Worldcon fans didn't watch films or own a TV. That's pretty much how I feel about the lack of a games award :)

(I suspect that many Hugo voters feel that games are inherently inferior to other forms in some way, but the idea that something like Mass Effect is fundamentally less worthwhile as a work of sf than, say, Babylon 5 - which won two Hugos - strikes me as very strange.)

It comes down to whether you can hold two ideas in your head at once - being interested by the shortlists as an alternative perspective on a genre you love without feeling that your own taste is being questions.

Cherryh's books or, I suspect, Leckie's 'Ancillary' books do win multiple Hugos.  They reflect con going fandom's view of the genre and that gives them a literary bias. ","It reflects the same fandom it always did - the fandom that loves books and reads widely and critically.  This includes a lot of media fans and comic book fans and film fans and cosplay fans.  You will almost certainly be interested in books if you attend or support a Worldcon - if you don't you'd be collecting actors' autographs or artist sketches somewhere. A large portions of this is Acafandom and prodom and people who aspire to those positions.","Good heavens, I don't know. I read their blogs, not their minds!  Most of the people I know who are actually in fandom (and this does not include a lot of people who read SF. My brother has read SF and fantasy since he was 6, and before that I read the comic books he bought to him, and he self-publishes his own young adult fantasies but he is not an active fan) are literary fans (and many of them are also filkers and comic book fans and media fans and academics in the field too) so I hope they share some attitudes in common.","I am furious with the SP/RP mob, who I think are driven by jealousy and right wing (and religious) fanaticism.  Admittedly, the Hugos were vulnerable and they took advantage. Just so you know, I am in favour of social justice. And fairly left wing.  (I also encountered Winterfox on LJ and ran like hell. That person is not a Social Justice Warrior but an anti-human, just like the puppies and like the gamergate idiots.)  However, from this country a lot of US rhetoric, of both left and right, reads very oddly indeed.  It really isn't all about the US experience. Or the UK experience. It is as well to remember it.

If I do buy a supporting membership and vote - and I am seriously considering it - 'No Award' is going to figure prominently - but we can get over this.

The path to ballots is done via networking (cons, SFWA membership, Codex voting blocs, workshop voting blocs, Writers of the Future scientology connections), which primarily privileges Americans by virtue of geography. For non-westerners, the costs of attending cons or networking-oriented workshops are financially deleterious.

Some non-Americans are successful. Here's why: Aliette de Bodard frequently attends cons in the UK and the US, is on the Codex forums, has attended Orson Scott Card's writing workshop, and IIRC won Writers of the Future.","No. They reflect popularity contests, networking, social capital and privilege. Mediocre-to-bad writers can claw their ways up the ballots as long as they schmooze well enough. There are voting blocs within the Codex writing forums, the SFWA itself, etc. All sections of fandom are mobs waiting to be weaponized, whether they happen to be led by Vox Day or an 'acceptable' liberal.","","Nobody in my area knows what a Hugo is. Not in Hong Kong, not in Thailand. Sorry. I expect mainland Chinese SFF scene knows of it, though. Probably the Japanese neither know nor care.","I'm apathetic. SFF comprises primarily of crypto-bigots masquerading as liberal allies and out-and-out bigots. Whichever set wins, bigots will still dominate the field and nothing will change. The Nielsen Haydens and Kathryn Cramer are still respected despite having been psychopathic harassers during Racefail '09 (not to mention that Cramer's gotten drunk and assaulted panelists in public at a con). Similarly, Harlan Ellison continues to be respected despite having groped Connie Willis onstage. John C. Wright is not going to lose his publishing contracts with Tor any time soon.","Not really.","Not really. The Locus Awards are political in a different way (essentially juried by Locus staff and affected by their politics/vendettas/whatever current dramas), the Tiptree is juried by Americans, the Clarke/Kitschies juried by Britons.

Too populist - Connie Willis's recent win for Blackout is a good example of popularity overshadowing quality. ","No, definitely not. Again, too US-centric, too white, too male, and too much slant in favour of space opera/military SF. Fantasy barely gets a look-in. ","I live in the UK where fandom (while still has some inclusiveness issues) is much more welcoming and open-minded. The Arthur C Clarke Awards tend to be held in higher esteem than the Hugos here","It is appalling. They have subverted SFF fandom to promote their own right wing, sexist, racist political agenda. SFF should be a mind-expanding genre where all kinds of ideas are explored. The puppies thing has hijacked fandom for their own ends and made a complete farce of the Hugos. Frankly I think the instigators should be publicly castigated for their offensive behaviour and total lack of respect for anyone who does not agree with their narrow-minded, bigoted prejudices. They do not represent me, nor any of the many SFF fans I know personally. ","I have more interest in the Best Novel, Best Novella, Best Short Story and Best Non-Fiction awards than in the art and TV/film awards. Just personal preference as I tend to read a lot. ","The Arthur C Clarke Award is most relevant, mainly because the long list books are nominated by their publishers, then read by a panel, cut down to a short list, which is then voted on by that same panel to find the winner. The panel is made up of writers and fans. Every stage is clearly set out and the panel members are publicised. I know people who have been part of the process and there is no input from anyone outside the panel when deciding on the award winner. Maybe the Hugos could learn from this, given the current debacle. ","Sadly the Hugos have fallen victim to the sad state of US politics, where white straight men believe their (very restricted) worldview is the only one worth considering. The puppies have elevated US-centric, right wing, militaristic, fundamentalist Christian politics to a position it does not merit, at the expense of anyone who does not agree with them. That is facism. The Nazis couldn't have dreamt up better. It is shameful and embarrassing to those of us who love SFF and welcome diversity in all its forms in our choice of reading material. Their hatred of women, POC, LGBT, for example, diminishes the Hugo awards and SFF fandom in general and frankly, it is offensive in the extreme. Sadly, the whole puppies scenario is a reflection of US society and the direction the political situation there is heading. I will not comply with their bully-boy tactics and sincerely wish the people in charge of the Hugos take note and enact measures to ensure this never happens again. ","",""

As far as I know, no non-Anglophone writer has ever won, and very few have been nominated. The Dramatic Presentation goes almost inevitably to Hollywood film and TV productions (with the exception of Doctor Who). The graphic novels also seem to be mostly American publications. ","No. There is a lot of Russian sf I am aware of that doesn't get translated and if it does, doesn't get nominated. So I assume that the situation is very similar for French, Chinese, Polish, Finnish, Indian SF, etc. Not even considering the language barrier, Australia and New Zealand publish a fair amount of quality SF and have never had a representative author nominated for Best Novel. Even the UK has a huge SF scene (Christopher Priest, Alastair Reynolds, Nick Harkaway and many others) which doesn't even get nominations. 

Also, the works that do get nominated tend to appeal to US politics and show US concerns --- a US view of racism and colonialism with not that much regard to class, a US view of the military, of capitalism and of health care. ","No. I have been to a WorldCon (Chicon 7 in 2012) and found that the attendees there, who are presumably mostly Hugo voters, are not as diverse as they try to be. The vast majority are American, with the remainder mostly Canadian (as trans-atlantic crossings for a convention are unfeasible for the UK and European scene, not to speak of the African, Asian and Australian fans). Also, the majority seem to be 40+ years old, middle class, and employed in white-collar jobs. (I am not going to speak of the racial breakdown as others have discussed it better than me and it appeals to a US definition of race.) ","A lot of Canadian fans who attend conventions follow the Hugos. However, a lot of the people I know enjoy Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones and YA fantasy and SF --- without it ever occurring to them to go to a convention or vote for the Hugos, or even that the Hugos are anything that matters. Some Canadian friends of mine pointedly ignore the Hugos as an American popularity contest. ","It is a problem of American politics on both sides, polarized over American issues of race and homophobia and an American idea of religion (Evangelicalism and Mormonism). The response to the Sad Puppies, though it aligns slightly better with my values, does not represent me either, as it is entirely focused on American political issues of anti-racism and anti-homophobia, in a situation that is very different even from Canada's. ","I am interested in the fiction categories. I don't really care about the Graphic Novel or Dramatic Presentation categories (even the filmmakers themselves don't care that they got a Hugo for best Dramatic Presentation, why would they?). I don't read fanzines and I find that the Best Related Work is a matter of what gets the most links rather than what is actually a best non-fiction work. I find it very difficult to judge who gets Best Editor, as the point of a good editor is that his or her work should be invisible. ","I recently have found the Kitschies very interesting in suggesting different and original novels in their nominees. I would read the World Fantasy Award winners, especially their short fiction. The Clarke Award can also recommend good novels. There are far fewer good awards for short fiction than for long. ","I hope the results of this survey see some eyeballs, but I am skeptical at how much the Hugo Awards/WorldCon can change, both from the American fan base being reluctant to move it, and the non-American fan base not caring about it.

That said, although I had never heard of him before this whole controversy, Larry Correia's posts have been unfailingly thoughtful and level-headed, while most of fandom's posts have been whiny and self-entitled. I disagree entirely with Correia's politics and esthetics, but he has legitimate gripes and makes convincing arguments about some of what's broken in fandom.","I don't care at all about any of the categories save for the four principal fiction categories, and to some extent also the ""related work"" category. I would care about some of the editor and zine awards, but their divisions and categorizations are so fraught with controversy that they're tainted. I especially do not care about all the ""fan"" categories. Even the four major fiction awards, I've long ago stopped paying close attention to, so rare is it that anything truly award-worthy gets any attention. The whole fandom popularity contest aspect of it all is very off-putting.","In theory, juried awards are more likely to be relevant, but fandom culture often infects those, too, as fandom-types become professionals (and jurors) whose esthetics skew toward fandom appeal rather than quality.","At this point, the best thing that could happen to SF would be for fandom to implode and disappear and stop embarrassing everyone.

","I haven't discussed it with them.","The organisers of the Sad Puppies, IMO, are upset because they weren't getting as many nominations as they thought they deserved, mainly because they have an exaggerated idea of how good they are. The Rabid Puppies are, as a former NZ prime minister put it, ""haters and wreckers"". I think there are genuine fans among the SP who don't see enough books reflecting their taste being honoured, and honestly think that's wrong, but the RP are a bunch of trolls overdue for some billygoats. ","Best Novel is the highest-profile one, and because I write short stories I'm also interested in the short story Hugo, though not all the stories nominated are usually to my taste. Related Work sometimes honours some worthy contributors to the field. I don't really care about the other categories and think they could be reorganised, particularly the mid-length literary awards. Hardly anyone writes or publishes novelettes now, and it's rare to meet one that isn't an overwritten short story. Novellas are becoming more popular because of e-publishing, but usually they're underdeveloped novels.","The Nebulas, because they're voted on by professional writers (albeit mainly American ones). 
The Sir Julius Vogels, our local awards, because I have some chance of winning one.
The Tiptrees, because they have more focus in their criteria and they're not a popular vote, but the decision of a judging panel. I'd much rather win a Tiptree than a Hugo, not that either one is likely.","","",""

I suspect a lot of my British fan friends don't regularly participate, and many older friends have given up on the Hugos entirely.Which I entirely accept.

I think, though, that Recent Events may have increased interest. I was at the British Eastercon for the announcement and a subsequent scratch panel to discuss what happened and the room was full. I didn't hear anybody at that panel or elsewhere expressing any support or sympathy for the SP/RP position. That may be a reflection of my friends -- who I imagine are all left/liberal -- and it may be that anybody who was SP/RP sympathetic wasn't inclined to speak up against the majority, but my general sense is that there's no support for the SP/RP movement in active British fandom, or at least that bit of it that I encounter.","I'm drawn to Martin Lewis's analysis, that we need to look at Hugo recommendations/slates against scales of Authority, Direction and Self-interest. As such I think both SP and RP and all slate-based activities are contrary to the spirit of the rules. I'm not a fan of the trend for self-promotion in the last decade or so -- probably because I'm British -- but I've not seen anything remotely comparable before and I think any suggestion that this is a response to some shady cabal that's been controlling the awards is nonsense.","Historically, the fan categories (disclosure: I'm a former nominee). Less so now, because of the way they've evolved -- although that's not to say that I disagree with the way they've evolved. Honestly, I think it was probably for the best, and they rarely reflected my view of what was good anyway. I do quite like the short fiction categories, because I don't read much of that these days and so the Hugos are a filter to give me a recommended reading list, from which I can usually bank on at least one or two really good pieces per category. I'm not really interested in the BDP categories. I've argued for years in favour of ditching all the categories we have now and rebuilding the Hugos from scratch for the 21st century, but I accept that it's probably not practical.","The Arthur C Clarke Award, which I've followed from the start, has generated what are to me consistently better shortlists than the Hugo. The Tiptree and the Kitschies are looking interesting. I do watch most major awards shortlists to a degree.","I'm entirely happy with the idea that the Hugos are the awards given out by the WSFS which is to say the Worldcon. I don't feel the need to make them more inclusive by hugely increasing the voter base, although I certainly don't object to more people wanting to participate in the Worldcon within the constraints of its fundamental nature. I hope this fuss doesn't destroy the Hugos but I don't think I'd be wildly upset if it did.

But then, I also think it's ridiculous to think that it could reflect all of SFF, or that it should.

I do feel that, historically, good works make it on the ballot. I don't always agree with the Hugo voting base, and sometimes lament the absence of a favored work, or raise an incredulous eyebrow at something that did make the ballot. Given that it's an award chosen by popular vote rather than a jury (i.e. representative of a broader range of tastes), this is not surprising.","I think Hugo Award voters reflect the opinions of the people who attend Worldcon and/or who care enough about the awards themselves to pay to vote. Nothing more, nothing less.

""Fandom"" is not one thing anymore, and as a term I'd argue that it's no longer only applicable to people who attend science fiction conventions. There are many ways to interact with other fans, authors, artists, etc., without ever once attending (or wanting to attend) a traditional SF convention. Frankly, this is a good thing, and I welcome the fresh fans and voices that come to the genre from anime, movies, TV, comics, and more.

However, it is very true to say that while the Hugo Award voters may be more representative of a particular slice of SFF fandom, their tastes are perhaps not representative of the wider science fiction and fantasy readership. I know many people who are big readers and primarily read SFF works but have no interest in SFF fandom, nor nominating/voting for awards. This does not mean that there is a flaw in the system; this is not representative of a conspiracy. Frankly, I think that SFF readership and fandom are becoming too large and diverse to be fully represented in a single award or slate of nominees--and I see this as a good thing.","Yes, I'd wager that many in my immediate circle would hold similar opinions. You'd certainly find a diversity of opinions if you were to survey all of Canadian fandom; however, at a recent convention I overheard and participated in a number of conversations relating to the recent SP/RP controversy, and found little support for either.","Ridiculous, frustrating, and an excellent example of the increasingly polarized ""us vs. them,"" ""left vs. right"" mindset one sees reflected so clearly in American politics.

I do not support SP or RP, and while I can understand the feelings of hurt/exclusion (etc.) expressed by some of the SP, I do not feel that their actions are correct or justified. I condemn RP wholeheartedly. Nor do I feel that their actions are representative of some great ""silent majority"" of SFF fans.

There is no one fandom! There is no right way or correct opinion. While SP/RP demonstrably represent a component of fandom, I do not see them as representing, speaking for, or championing fandom as a whole.","The novel category is really a standout. As I don't read a lot of short fiction, the three short (or shorter) fiction categories are generally of less interest. Categories like ""Best Editor"" and ""Best Artist"" rarely seem to reflect the work done in a particular year and often just seem like a general popularity contest (though I certainly think that artists, editors, fan writers, etc., deserve to be recognized for their work).

Rather than so much focus on short SF (which, I'd argue, used to be more important to the genre than it is today), I'd love to see a few novel categories -- perhaps Best SF, Best Fantasy, etc. Maybe even recognition for the great work being done for writers of YA SFF.","I find a number of awards interesting, but have no one ""go to"" award in terms of something that will always match my taste or opinions.","Unlike SP/RP, I was quite happy to see the increasing diversity of authors and works represented on recent Hugo ballots, and quite enjoy some more ""literary"" SFF works.","",""

I usually don't care at all about checking up on who got a nomination or a prize. You just tend to notice it on the blurbs on the book cover. But I rely far more on other forms of recommendations: books clubs, social media, friends in general, praise from authors I like. ","Change the nomination and award process for Hugo or I will never care the smallest bit about that prize in the future.

"236",236,"4/24/2015 3:55:48","United Kingdom","I think I've always known about them, but probably from seeing 'Hugo award winning author' on book covers.","No","No","","I've only recently become aware of the details of how they're decided, because of the current controversy. If you ask the questions above a year from now, my answers will be 'yes' instead of 'no', because I had no idea I, as an ordinary fan, could participate in the process. Given what I now know, I would say not, because they are nominated and voted upon by a subset of fans who may, or may not, be representative of fans as a whole. I also agree with one commentator who has pointed out that the literary categories do not represent the huge shift in speculative fiction over the past 30 years from the short form dominating the genre to novels, and series of novels, being the main stories. It would be good to see that reflected, perhaps by introduction of an additional category for series. And then, speculative fiction has exploded into mainstream acceptance in my lifetime and the sheer volume and variety of what is out there means no single award can possibly represent everything, any more than the Pulitzer or Booker prizes represent the whole of fiction.","I think it unlikely, for the reasons given above. There are just so many more people reading and watching speculative fiction these  days. It's no longer something you hide, embarrassed to be reading those 'silly' books. When I started reading in the genre it was still seen as pulp fiction.  Now it's mainstream and popular with all segments of society, even the literary snobs.","I have no idea, I'm afraid. I don't really discuss my reading with people, and I'm not hugely social in general. The next time I'm likely to see people with whom I could even mention the Hugos and feel like they might be aware of them is November. All of this kerfuffle will be dying away by then.","I think it is very sad. On the positive side, it has made me aware that *I* can participate in deciding the awards. However, it seems to me, in general, to be a bad thing. Those who are awarded a Hugo this year won't be able to take an unalloyed pleasure in it because it is tainted by the enormously vitriolic war of words going on. The Puppies of both flavours are no more representative of fans as a whole than any one group of people can be. It also appears, from what I have been reading (at sometimes interminable length), that their agenda is self-serving--in the case of the Rabid Puppies, egregiously so, based on the content of their slate. I don't see the Puppies' opponents as representative of all fans either, although some of those are coming out with thoughtful, nuanced commentaries that help to elucidate the whole mess. On the whole, I find myself out of sympathy with the Puppies as their argument seems very much that they are having to share an award they see as 'theirs' with other people who are not them and their friends. Their contention, for example, that speculative fiction is becoming politicised and that it wasn't before makes me wonder which alternative universe  they've been inhabiting. The best SF, from writers they seem to revere, was always political.  The genre has always been used to enable discussion of political issues, as evidenced by writing from the McCarthy era. The whole thing can be summed up by one comment I saw that 'what we're seeing here is a paradigm shift'.  Those are always difficult as established interests are replaced by a new order and those who are having to share their power or privilege fight back against it.","The literary categories for me.  I'm a compulsive reader, now well into middle age, and pages full of words are very much my thing.  I never really connected with comics and graphic novels came along after my tastes were set.  I still associate them very much with children's entertainment, however well I know intellectually that they are not.  For some reason I don't really connect well with film and TV representations either, despite growing up with Star Trek, Dr Who and Star Wars.","My awareness of awards beyond the Hugos and Nebula is non-existent, so I'm unable to comment here.","Now that I know I, as an ordinary reader, can contribute to these awards, I'm going to be doing so. That's exciting.  Given the backlash against the way the Puppies have gamed the system this year, squeezing out people who may have been eminently award-worthy but do not fit their definition of speculative fiction, I suspect the way nominations are made will be the primary topic of conversation at Worldcon. Whether changes will be implemented to outlaw slates in future, I don't know, but if they are, determined individuals will find a way round it.  The thing that makes me most sad, though, is that many people's first knowledge of the Hugos will be coloured by the fight currently going on.  It tarnishes what I have always seen as a prestigious recognition of merit and people will always wonder in future about the agenda behind any given nomination or award.  It's particularly hard for writers nominated via one of the Puppy slates because something that should have been a matter for celebration has instead become a cause for soul searching and some difficult decisions.","",""

","No","Yes","The voting audience seems skewed toward American works.  Authors who sell well in the US get lots of votes, this relates to having US publishers actively pushing their work to US booksellers.  Britains, Australians, etc, do far less well unless they have strong US publishers and sell very well in the US.

It's not ""just"" a US award.  But there's definitely a strong bias there.
","This year?  No.

Most years?  Kind of.  Some ideas old, some ideas new, some ideas borrowed, some ideas blue.  Some of it's good, some of it's crap.
","The Hugo award voters seem older (and because of that, more conservative) than fandom as a whole.  But SF has conquered the world: just like we are all ""gamers"" now, we are all ""SF fans"" too.

Historically the Hugos have had a bit of the wierd knee-jerk libertarianism that hard-core US SF fans have also had:  I cannot see any other reason why crap work like Niven and Pournelle's ""Fallen Angels"" got nominations except that they were about plucky US libertarian SF fans fighting the evil environmentalists.

(Niven and Pournelle also wrote great stuff, but that wasn't)","No idea.","The two times I did attend a big US SF con (in the late 90s) I found the very conservative US fans quite cliquish.  

Saying something that was critical of a libertarian viewpoint at a US SF con panel discussion very much got me dumped on. So much so that I never went back to another con.  It seemed obvious that all the cool kids in fandom were libertarian and outsider geeks like me were not supposed to offer other views.

Given my experience I find the SP/RP complaints about how ostracised one is for being a (shock!) libertarian as a SF con is very, very, very strange.","Novel and Novella, obviously.  Like everyone else.

I'm sometimes interested by the ""Related Works"", though they are sometimes about US-based SF fandom (which I find boring) rather than SF (which I love).","They've all got good and bad points.  

Despite the criticisms I gave above, the Hugos are worthwhile.  Imperfect, like all things in this subluminary sphere, but I'll usually at least pick up the year's Hugo winner novel and read the blurb - and usually buy it.  I'll often check out the nominees.
","The SP/RP thing is a storm in a teacup.  15 years from now only geeks like you and me will remember this fight.

In hindsight, the banning of ""The Martian"" as ineligible will be part of a much bigger deal.  And the story of Wright's that suffered the same fate.  These are the true signs of big problems to come for the Hugos.

That's because self-publishing is going to become more common, and for self-published works from new authors it's usual for works to start with small sales and very slowly ramp us (as opposed to when a publisher pushes your works).  That means that by the time they're popular enough to win a Hugo, they'll be more than a year old.  This game is (inadvertantly) rigged against self-published works and in favor of publishers, and in the long run that's going to matter far more for the Hugo than canine sadness.","",""

The Hugos might technically be a global award, but that really is just a technicality.","No. I think sf/f is far broader in scope and ambition than is reflected in the Hugo nominations, even if the Sad/Rabid Puppies slates of the past two years were eliminated from consideration.","It depends on what you mean by 'fandom.' If you're talking about the con-going, niche social/cultural groupings who self-define as fandom, then I'd say the Hugo voters are a particularly US-centric subset of that. If you mean the far broader swathe of regular and passionate readers of speculative fiction who think of themselves as fans, but have mostly never heard of 'fandom', then no. ","Absolutely (and this is less about geographic than demographic area). Friends and I have shared, recommended and discussed sf/f books among ourselves for years - we were 'fans' as described above - but it was only when I became an author that any of us discovered the existence of conventions and 'fandom'. The tales I bring back to them from that world make their eyes boggle. ","1. The current fiasco has highlighted both how important the Hugos are to the SP/RP cabal, and how insular the Hugos' eligibility and voting procedures are; they're essentially disconnected from the broad sf/f readership. In the process the fiasco has just confirmed their irrelevance to that readership. More than that: because the SP/RP actions have spilled over into mainstream media, that broader readership is now being alerted to the fundamental untrustworthiness of the Hugo brand.
2. I think slate-based voting is dishonourable, no matter who does it.
3. The SP/RP proponents and opponents represent opposing factions of self-defined niche 'fandom'; neither of them have much to do with the majority of sf/f readers.

It is telling, of course, that ""Are non-American works eligible?"" is included in the Hugo FAQ on Sasquan's website - I sincerely hope that it isn't, in fact, a frequently asked question, but perhaps it is.  In any case, the Anglosphere pretty much owns the Hugos as I see it, which means that my culture and world are not included. I don't see that as a problem, I'm not used to reading any kind of fiction that is actually aware of my culture and it doesn't bother me, though perhaps it should.","Terribly difficult question. Mostly, yes, but I think that's because I am not really aware of the non-Anglo works to the extent that I would like to be. Looking at the question from a broader perspective, no, it really doesn't reflect sf/f, because I know that there are a lot of works being written in languages I don't read, and by authors who are not promoted in the places where I see them. So I guess I would like the awards to reflect a much broader spectrum of sf/f, including the parts of it that I don't usually see.

If the question is ""Should the Hugos be more about fun space operas/swashbuckling in an age where men are men and women are women and there's none of this boring preachy content about diversity"", then, no, no they shouldn't. The best works of science fiction and fantasy are those that present new ways of thinking, and challenge our preconceptions. If this is done in an entertaining way, so much the better, but I think that's usually the case with the best writers. And I frankly find many of the ""classics"" by Heinlein et al to be pretty boring.","No, I don't. The Hugo Award voters are the members of Worldcon, and that's a tiny subset of fandom, mainly consisting of people from one single country (no points for guessing which one).  I know that American culture is not uniform, but it is foreign and different from other cultures all the same, and American fandom is different from other fandoms.","I think some people perhaps do, and some people probably don't. I don't think there is any kind of uniformity in this regard.  Since I live in a non-English speaking country, I imagine that there is a difference between people who are comfortable reading in English and those who are not. (Many Swedes have a reasonably good grasp of English, but most of us are very far from being bilingual, and many Swedes don't really enjoy reading in English. I think sf fans are probably more likely to read in English than the average Swede, though.)","The Sad/Rabid puppies don't represent any part of fandom that I am familiar with. That doesn't mean that there's no part of fandom that agrees with them, but fandom, as I see it, is by definition a diverse place, and so any kind of slate is counter-fannish (to coin a term) in that it represents a limitation or even negation of that diversity. That would apply to any anti-puppy slates as well, of course. 

As for the opponents, those are wildly diverse and frequently disagree with each other, sometimes quite vehemently, in all the discusions I have followed... so yes, they (we) do represent fandom, inasfar as fandom can ever be represented by anything. ","I don't watch a lot of films and TV series, and almost none of it is sf/f - I simply don't enjoy that medium as much as I do written text. Hence I usually haven't seen any of the movies or TV series that are nominated so I don't vote for them, and I never nominate for those categories, either.","I'm usually a little more interested in the Clarke Award and BSFA Award winners than in the Hugo winners, though there's not that much of a difference between them. I don't know much about other awards, though I've been thinking that I should look into that a bit more, now that the Hugos are broken this year, and maybe next year as well.","This survey is an excellent idea, but of course it will only get the opinions and thoughts of people who are sufficiently familiar with English to respond to an English-language survey.

And other countries have their own awards. The BSFA, the Vogels, the Ditmars... does the US even have an award of their own or is it the Hugo by default?  

","Eh. Not really - it's not nearly as wide-ranging or imaginative as it thinks it is. Still very focused on Anglo work - UK and US especially.  ","I don't know. I've never been able to go to Worldcon (too far, too expensive) so I've never seen the voter herd in the flesh, if you get my drift. ","I haven't talked to a lot of people about this, but the majority seem to roll their eyes. There's a sort of unsurprised disgust. I know that SFWA isn't the same as Worldcon, but there seem to be the same arguments, the same players, the same weird-arse political backdrop. The same expectation that I give the tiniest shit either way about Mike Resnick. ","How do I view it - it's a very American bunfight, politicised along American lines. I don't know any other developed country that's so rabid in its politics, and of course what's labelled as ultra left-wing, SJW work there is often the centrist position in other countries. The SP do seem very aligned with the worst of right-wing Republicanism - or at least how they present themselves to outsiders. Have no time for them. 

The controversy doesn't really have much context in a NZ or even Australasian environment. I can't see such dichotomies ever gaining that amount of traction here. 

The whole thing just makes me feel even more... disenfranchised, if that's the word, from Worldcon. I've never been a member and frankly, this puts me off wanting to be one. ","Novels and novellas.

This may be partly because it is an English-language award and partly because Worldcon, despite its name, is biased towards American. I don't mean to imply that American authors are necessarily favored, but you probably have to come to the attention of the American voting base to be nominated. I daresay this is affecting southern hemisphere authors, etc, even more than British/Irish ones.","It's a diverse area in terms of types of literature, but an award should tend to reflect the best of the field rather than what's typical. There's a lot of stuff in sf/f that we read to pass the time, which I wouldn't consider award worthy. In other words, I do think the Hugos have been biased towards exceptional quality or entertainment value, as they should be. 

In terms of areas of interest (social diversity, military sf, to take some examples) I think the number of categories is too small and too centered around form rather than content to do justice to all those areas year after year. I feel the allocation of the awards haven't been particularly influenced by such factors in the past.","I think it takes a particularly dedicated kind of fan to stay current with enough of what happened in a give year to feel comfortable nominating in all those categories. Most of the books I read in a given year were published much earlier. Also I only have a pronounced interest in certain forms.","I've heard a similar opinion expressed from time to time, though it's rather drowned in the current controversy and the desire people feel to become active on one political side or another.","Yes, it was slate-based voting. It set out to be slate-based, it admits it was slate-based, it was effective in a way only slate-based voting could be.

In answer to the second question, I think I expressed myself better in the comment box at the end, so I deleted what I first wrote.","I prefer the novel form and its the only category in which I'm really likely to feel qualified to nominate. That doesn't mean I want other categories ruined for people who are interested in them, of course.","Well, the Nebulas had a better list of books this year. ","I'm not really an award focused person. Awards do tend to find 'good' books but I'm under no illusions that they find the best books or all the good books. Sure, authors feel honored when they get them, but (in selfish terms), what's that to the rest of us? What do awards do?

Well, they tend to create a common reading list after the fact, so that all of fandom is now united in being, at the very least, aware of Ancillary Justice. Everyone has an opinion on it and it creates the possibility of common conversations (or arguments). Maybe awards serve an important role in binding fandom together?

But then, they also serve to define the boundaries of fandom. People who are not interested in having those conversations (or arguments) will remove themselves from fandom or form break away groups. Some people aren't interested in seeing how many gender identities we can invent and other think that if all we can do with spaceship technology is attack alien races, let's not have them. That's the situation I think we're now in. 

'We' - fandom till now present at Worldcon - will likely no longer assent to be part of the same group. It's a shame if 'we' can't nevertheless consent to share a common space, and that's happening because groups have formed who are willing to show hostility to each other. 

In my perception, the SP group have interpreted lack of universal recognition and special status as hostility, and responded by showing actual hostility to those who were merely disinterested in them. The RP group are unashamedly hostile to a great many people. 

Both groups, incidentally, epitomize the American-ness of Worlcon/Hugo fandom. Several of Vox Day's public pronouncements constitute illegal hate speech in much of Europe which does not have the same free speech laws as the US. Larry Correia's pro-gun involvements are less heinous but also can't legally exist in Europe. A lot of the background context for the battles they've created around this year's Worldcon are only really topical for Americans.","",""

I only found out that I could actually vote on the Hugo awards due to the Sad Puppies campaign because they explained the supporting membership process.","Sometimes","Yes","The dominant English culture in North America (likely the world but I don't travel enough to know for sure) is American.  So it is a fact of life that awards given for English cultural works will be dominated by American tastes/fans. ","Assuming ""as I see it"" means my personal opinion

Having read all the nominations for the 2013 year, in general no.  There were many stories with flat characterization and minimal plotting serving only to setup a ""hook"" ending or remind me of a previous story/stories that had done a similar concept better.  There were a handful of stories that stood out to me as much better.

Over my reading lifetime, I feel the Hugo awards, in general, have drifted away from stories I like and will reread to stories I find boring or depressing and will not reread.  There are exceptions of course.

Assuming ""as I see it"" means my view of everyone's opinion of the works

Having read all the nominations for the 2013 year, in general yes.  I can see how someone (not the same someone for each story) would like almost all of the stories and can see how they are considered worthy of an award.  Not necessarily a sf/f award mind you - since a few of the stories had only the smallest connection to a concept related to sf/f.

I have not followed how prior years works have been received by fandom in general to have an informed opinion.  I will suggest that statistically any publishing house having a sustained different portion of recent Hugo nominations in certain categories compared to their market share in the sf/f field is primary evidence to suggest a disconnect between the nominated works and the entire field of sf/f.

","When I think of sf/f fandom, I think of the large conventions that get news coverage - mainly to look/laugh at the nerds.  I do not attend conventions, so others may think of smaller local conventions that are less ""young"" (not correct word, I can't think of a better way to describe the concept).
  
I do not believe the Hugo award voters in the recent past reflect that larger fandom or tie-in novels would be nominated and likely win the awards.  The small number of actual Hugo award voters would be proof in my mind.

I believe the publicity generated by recent campaigns may help bring more voters into the Hugo award process which is only a good thing.  

","First, why should I care?  My opinion is my own - do you think I should have external validation?

Second, this is my opinion at this point in time.  It may, and likely will, change in the future as my experiences/knowledge accumulate.  I expect that of others as well so my friends that may have shared my opinion in the past could have changed their minds and vice versa.

Thirdly, I expect very few people care at all about the Hugo awards meaning there is a limited number of people in my area that would have an opinion.  And I have no idea what those few people's opinion is.","A. I believe Sad Puppies 1 and 2 demonstrated that the Hugo process was fairly followed based on the number of people involved.  It also demonstrated that a vocal (hopefully small) portion of the small number of people voting/nominating were not open to new external people joining the Hugo nominating/voting process.

B. I am ashamed of the histrionics of the vocal (again hopefully small) portion of the Hugo awards that demanded the presenter resign because he may tell a joke that may offend people.  This was censorship at it's worst since it is based on a possibility not an actuality.

C. Promotion of works eligible for the Hugo award have existed for a long time, likely as long as the awards have.  I see no difference between individual work promotion and a recommended reading list and a slate to garner attention to particular works.  A vote is a vote is a vote and to think otherwise is a move away from democratic principles.  

D. Assuming Larry C, Brad T speak for Sad Puppies and Teresa NH and Patrick NH speak for the anti-Sad Puppies and ignoring the vocal minority supporting each side as best as I can.  I see one side consistently saying here are works I liked, read the works and vote for the ones you like.  I see the other side saying the Hugo awards this year need an asterisk indicating the wrong stories have been nominated at best, or declaring no award without reading the works at worst.  And in the prior year saying see told you that your stories were not good enough for an award.  One side seems more like a baby saying ""nyah-nyah I was right"" last year and taking their ball and going home this year, which is not a behaviour I encourage in anyone assumed to be an adult.  

E. I expect the vast majority of fandom doesn't give a hoot about the Hugo awards or this controversy.

F. I expect the majority of the minority of fandom that knows about the Hugo awards controversy would vote a pox on both their houses if that's what it takes to get everyone to just shut up about it so they could get back to talking/doing things that interest them (such as tricks to making a good costume).

G. The small minority of fandom that is involved in Sad Puppies or the opposition to it have hardened their positions and appear not to be willing to converse/accomodate/compromise with the other side.

H. My personal bias is to involving more people in the Hugo process so I encourage both sides to sell more memberships.  Sadly, one side appears to want to change the rules to discourage/prevent more involvement so I believe that side feels they have less popular support.","Yes.
Novels and movies seem like the most important/visible category to me.

Editors and fanzine type categories seem more like industry insider awards, where only people involved in the category even know the nominations let alone the broader field to make the nominations.

Certainly not exclusively; the Hugos have recognized British, Canadian and (I believe) other English-language SF&F writers, publications, podcasts, TV shows, etc. But since most Worldcons take place in the U.S., most Hugo voters are American, and are most familiar with works available in the U.S. market. ","They reflect a particular subset of SF&F.

There's a generational component, as well.","If you mean my area geographically, then yes. Canadian SF&F literary fandom operates in an interesting liminal space, in that we overlap significantly with U.S. fandom without being entirely of it.

People within fandom can be part of many communities of fans. No one group entirely represents ""fandom as I see it"" because fandom is too large and diverse to be so easily categorized. 

However, given that every sensible human being I know could be described as opposed to the SPs/RPs, I suppose that very broad group represents fandom as I see it reasonably well.

The SPs are part of fandom, but not a large part. I've described them as an angry, conservative rump when trying to explain this year's Hugos debacle to people outside of fandom. But as much as I abhor their behaviour, their tactics, their arguments, their choices and their endless whining... they are still part of fandom. ","I really don't follow short fiction, so I don't feel particularly drawn to those categories -- I agree with Eric Flint that there are more short fiction categories in the Hugos than makes sense in today's market. I suspect that even most Hugo voters couldn't explain to anyone's satisfaction what a novelette actually is.

While I understand that many people get excited about the Dramatic Presentation categories, I find them largely irrelevant to literary SF&F, which is supposed to be the point of the Hugos.

I am always interested in the nominations for Best Novel, Best Graphic Story, Best Fan Writer and Best Related Work. I think those categories are where a lot of the real heavy lifting in terms of moving the genre forward takes place, and the nominations tend to reflect that.","More relevant? Not entirely.

But in all honesty, I mind more that Worldcon is called ""World"" con and happens most often in America than the fact the Hugos are an American award. They are. Why should they not be? As more ""world"" get put into Worldcon (and I feel that it has in the last decade, and with 3 nonUS bids vs 1 US bid and online voting fee payments enabled I feel it is certainly becoming more so), the Hugo awards will start to reflect that too. Once we survive the Puppies. 

In fact, the may have helped speed this process along. Many who have not voted so far - because 40 bucks goes a long way in some of the Eastern European countries - will do this year. 

Croatian fandom has a special presentation at the national con explaining the entire thing to those who do not actively follow the Anglo fandom and fans who have never voted have announced they are setting funds aside to do so. Just to put it into perspective: the minimum monthly wage in Croatia currently is $340, the most expensive con in Croatia is $13 for a full three-day membership. ","No. They used to be an awesome recommendation reading list, along side the Nebulas and Locus.

","No. My SF fandom is a lot larger than that and younger, but I do not expect any institution to reflect the situation in the field, as it were. 
When I felt the need to change this, I figured out a way to overcome the lack of funs and joined. Despite being foreign and female - from what I hear online and in disucssions about gender parity, inclusivity etc. -  I can still say that my own personal experience in US and Anglophone fandom in general has been nothing but warm, welcoming and great, esp considering I am an Eastern European fan who came out of nowhere and out of the blue a couple of years back and went straight for the jugular, as in ""Hi! I want to run this con of yours"" without so much as a good day practically.

I used to figure it was because I live where I live, and not everybody speaks English that well - I blamed it on their lack of talent and lack of reading anything published in SF after 1950.

that this has occurred in the SF/F community, which -particularly in the case of SF - strives to look outwards, is very concerning.  There is no 'what if' and 'can we' and 'wide possibilities' in the proponents of the controversy.  It seems to be a 'back when' stance which seeks to place the romanticised past ahead of the possibilities of improvement and future.

I am aware that the Hugos are awarded by attendees of a convention, and that convention is mostly held in the US.  But to me, it is still mostly a US convention.

Here in Australia we have our own awards - the Ditmars and the Aurealis. I expect other countries to have their own awards.  

I always think of the US having two sf/f awards. Hugos and Nebulas. (And the Locus awards.) 

Interestingly, I think of the World Fantasy awards as being more international.","Yes and no.

The Hugos are also mostly about the written word. Or rather, the prestige in the Hugos is for books, magazines and web presence rather than media like television or films (after all, they want the Oscars and the Emmys), thus I am only talking here about books, magazines/ezines and fandom.

Most years I find that the list of finalists reflects pretty well on what is out there. There are some misses, but mostly hits.

It also reflects (which the Sad Puppies seem to object to) that the people who write SF are less and less straight, white, US males.","It's only people who go to a specific convention who vote for this award. There are a lot of sf/f fans who do not go to these cons. Many who don't even know they're on.

A lot of fans find sf/f now via film or television. They may or may not go onto books.  They go to the big commercial cons if they go at all (e.g. C2E2), they don't go to WorldCon.

I don't mind that the WorldCon people vote for the Hugos rather than, say, the fans in general. The people who go to the convention read books, in general. They watch movies and tv shows as well, but they do read. They're the ones I want to vote.","I don't know.  ","Lots of opinions on this. (Doesn't everyone.) In no particular order:

- It wasn't cheating, but it does leave a nasty taste in one's mouth and predispose one against SP/RP.  (As the English would say, ""Just not cricket."")
- Brad Torgersen comes across as a sort loser. i.e. he lost a Hugo, feels he was robbed, and started SP as a result.
- Vox Day -- scarily creepy.
- SP/RP -- totally out of touch with modern sf/f I know and enjoy, living back in the fifties. 
- The other side - disappointing. I wanted them to behave with dignity, but not all of them have.
- There's some good sf/f coming out at the moment, but the SP/RP along with the recent controversy over cosplayers at cons has made me wonder how big the 'conservative' movement is in the field. And it's making me worry. People in our field are good to each other. I don't want that spoiled.
- I also feel extremely sorry for those people that SP/RP nominated (outside of the obvious ones). Some of these are really good and should have been on the list anyway (e.g. Sheila Gilbert and Anne Sowards on the the long-form editors list. Australia's own Andromeda Spaceways In-Flight Magazine for SemiProzine.). If they win, they won't ever get the credit they deserve.","I like the categories that are related to books.

My favorite is the Best novel, then Novella and Novelette, best editor long-form -- but I like them all. The nominees give me a good idea of what's happening in the field.","Not more relevant, but equally relevant is the Nebula. I look on this as other writers nominating books they like.

Also the Locus awards.  They are more book-specific (which is obviously what I like), but it's never clear to me who can vote for them, so I tend to look on them as not quite 'up there'. [I know that subscribers to the magazine can vote, and I subscribe, but I don't subscribe direct through Locus and I have no idea if my votes count or are discarded as a result.]

","I respect the Hugos. To me it is still 'the' award to win. I don't want it devalued by SP/RP.

I was surprised to find that it doesn't take many votes to get something nominated. That is, that less people nominate than vote.

I'd hate to see a massive knee-jerk reaction to 'fix' slate fixing, just for the sake of reacting. I am concerned the SP/RP fiasco has damaged the Hugos.I hope that it hasn't.  I'd hope that any solution is considered and sensible. Better, that we could all be relied on to just behave, nominate if we've bought con tickets.

I really am disappointed in some of the over-reaction from fans opposing SP/RP. It drags us all down to their level. It's kind of like having a racist, sexist, foul-mouthed grandfather who embarrasses you, but mostly you try to keep him controlled and out of the way of innocent passers-by, then the whole family starts being racist, sexist and foul-mouthed too.

I think a couple of years ago I would have said yes to the Hugos being a primarily US award but obviously we did have Loncon last year.  I think I do feel that sf/f is a largely US field still as so much still only gets published in the US so the awards would naturally reflect that. ","To a large degree I think so but there will always be works missed as the field of nominations is small - in particular, I no longer subscribe to Asimov and Analog so my reading of shorter fiction has decreased dramatically (but my online reading has increased).  By having so many awards for shorter fiction but only one for novels means that I find that the shorter fiction awards are still fairly reflective and seem to cast a wider net (similarly for online fanzinesetc.), however the novel award nominations can never reflect the whole field and some years feel skewed towards one type of sf/f (but that is statistically what I would expect to happen).","I have to say that when I started reading sf/f it was still a time where this was perceived to be a white male area.  I have felt over the last decade a shift towards a more open an inclusive sf/f society.  I am bemused by all the different levels and degrees of fandom though and how so many of them seem exclusionary - you aren't as proper a fan as me because ...  I assume voters are self selecting and that fans who really care about the awards would vote (with the caveat that many, like me, would not have realised how easy it was to be able to vote).  I do feel though that this year's nominations do not reflect 'fandom' specifically due to the following:
1). The RP/SP3 slates seem to have been designed specifically to FILL the nominations - I.e. Not to recommend or add to the nominations but to exclude all other works.
2). Leading on from 1, the success of the slates in excluding non-slate works makes me feel that the voters this year are not representative of the whole gamut of fandom.
3). The fact that so many nominations are for the same person and one I have never heard of seems suspicious (however, I am aware that as a UK fan there are gong to be large swathes of unknown sf/f territory so I may well be wrong on this point).
4). The fact that so many nominations were published by a tiny press owned by Theodore Beale/Vox Day frankly makes me sick  - it seems obvious that this small publisher has used other fans to improve his own financial dealings and has lied to them, hiding the true goal behind other ideas and manipulating people who have become involved in all good faith.  I will also note that, having read a small amount of Vox Day's writings online I am ashamed that the outside world might associate me, a sf/f fan, with him and his views.

I would also note that I feel very sorry for the nominated people this year as they will have been tainted by the controversery and what should be one of the highlights of their careers cannot be the happy event it should be.
","Those I have discussed this with, yes.","I have actually spoken at length about this in an earlier section.  I find it hard to trust even the more reasonable amongst the SP/RP due to the exclusionary nature of their slate (pushing all other works out as the expressed goal) and also due to the name-calling and use of acronyms blatantly designed to insult the other side (SHW, Chorts etc.).  I do think that the SP/RP 'side' has suffered from association with Vox Day and also because the SP rationale seems to have changed over the years.  I am also more naturally drawn to the opponents side but have been horrified by some of the attacks made and would not want my name associated with the extremists on either side.

I do think that a positive side effect of this will have been to make more fans, like myself, aware we could nominate and vote in Hugos and I feel that next year will be self-correcting and this year is a sad blip in the sf/f world.

I think that the arguments have also drawn out a very wide range of fans and have hopefully widened participation.  Although, I would like the very narrow SP/RP arguments to die down quickly and the discussion to turn to sharing sf/f we all love and how a wider group of fans can become more engaged.

Finally, I always thought that sf in particular was about breaking barriers and hope and the future and I have been saddened by the SP/RP situation as the group seem to be gong expressly against that element of sf which I love (one example is the cereal analogy).","As I mentioned above, I am currently reading a lot less short fiction so the to shows/films, online categories and novel are the ones currently more relevant to me.  However, I have previously subscribed to various periodicals and will probably do so again.  I also think that the sf/f is unique in its awarding and recognition of shorter fiction and that this allows us to 'grow' amazing authors in a way that other fields don't.  I find that the first novels published by sf/f authors seem of significantly higher quality than those in other genres I read.  (Please note that I am not implying that shorter fiction is easier or less worthy than novels - there are novelists who are rubbish at writing short stories/novellas/novelettes as they do require different skills.  But the time investment in shorter fiction is, well, shorter, allowing authors to hone their skills as they go through the story telling cycle more times, more quickly).","Before this controversery, I would have ranked Hugos, Nebulas and World Fantasy Awards roughly equally.  I would use any award, even the smaller ones or awards I haven't heard of, as a signifier of quality, that the story was interesting but I wouldn't automatically buy anything just because it won an award - I would ask friends or read a sample first but an award can help bring something to my attention (like an author quote on a cover or a recommendation from a trusted blog or a friend).","I will be getting a supporting membership for next year's WorldCon and nominating and voting.  I am also saving up to attend a WorldCon in the next few years.  I think the whole SP/RP has made me realise that, if I want sf/f to be an opening and welcoming community I need to be more actively involved to help that happen.","",""

I do think the Hugos broadly reflect the tastes of fandom as a whole.","Yeah, I think it does.I think they're fairly representative of the readers of SF/F all across the Anglophone world. I think most readers are exposed broadly to the same books--dominated by the big 5 publishers and  North American writers. 

I believe it is less reflective of fandom outside of readers--fans of movie and television who don't read SF/F books.","I think mine is a pretty commonly held opinion. ","I can't understand how a group, or two groups, can actively oppose increased diversity when they are supposed to be writers interested in the new and the fantastic. I think it's foolish of them to indulge in conspiracy theories and I think they are indulging in the professional victimhood they usually ascribe to their so-called enemies. I agree that the social justice movement has been guilty of online bullying of those who do not subscribe to their politics but, for the Puppies to align themselves with Gamergate, whose misbehaviour extends well beyond twitter-bullying, is utterly hypocritical. 

I think it's poor sportsmanship for them to hijack the Hugo awards and to me it speaks of sour grapes. 

I think fandom sits somewhere in the middle of this controversy, but I expect that this will drive them away from the Puppies, both Sad and Rabid. It has certainly done so for me.","The novel categories, I think. I believe more novels are consumed by fandom than short stories and I expect these categories are more representative of the values of the voters. ","I am more likely to pay attention to the Nebula Awards. 

Juried awards have their own problems but it has always seemed to me that it's more likely that juries will have read, or attempted to read all of the books upon which they are voting. 

Also, there is less capacity for campaigning and block voting to sway the result. ","Yes! I'd love to see some surveys with hard data. 

Where DOES fandom stand on these issues? 

What proportion of award winners are North America? What proportion of the publishers are from the Big 5? 

Are the Hugo voters representative of fandom in general?

What is the proportion of fandom that reads books as well as consuming SF/F in other media?","",""

There is a tendency to nominate the same few people time and again, but there is nothing new about that.    ","Again, prior to 2015 the voting population reflected those fans who were deeply committed to fandom, whether in the sense of (say) volunteering at cons, or in the sense of blogging and talking about books, films and artists.

There's been a large uptake of voting memberships this year. Some of those are obviously supporters of the Puppy slates, but quite a lot must be people like me, who saw what happened last year and how the wind was blowing this year, and decided to register. I've been reading sf for nearly fifty years, but rarely bothered to register to vote. The controversy has at least stirred me into action!    ","Broadly, yes. Offhand, I can't think of anyone who supports the aims of the Puppies. Most of us are horrified at the idea of a certain writer receiving six nominations - his work is neither original or interesting. Equally, most of us find the indignation of their opponents faintly amusing. This kind of slate voting was bound to happen eventually. Minor tinkering with the rules could prevent it in years to come - reduce the number of nominations in each category an individual is allowed to make.     ","While I can understand the feeling among the Puppies that the Hugos have fallen into the hands of a small clique who keep voting for each other - and I think the reaction on the Neilsen Hayden blog has only reinforced that impression - the introduction of a slate seems to me against the spirit of fandom. The extremists on both sides are behaving badly - the sense of entitlement, of ownership, coming from parts of the ""SJW"" camp is almost as nauseating as the Rabid Puppies.
  
Increasing the number of fans who vote seems to me a good thing, but I'd rather they thought for themselves than followed someone else's edict! And I suspect that after a few years only those who are truly interested in the field will continue to vote - the rest will fade away as some new cause comes to light.    ","For me, the novel, novella, novelette and short story are the most important categories, with best pro artist fifth and best related sixth. The rest don't matter to me as much - I prefer the written word.","The Nebula, maybe, but AS relevant, not more relevant!","At the end the contretemps all seems very American and very self-indulgent.

The core Hugo categories for me are the novel and 3 short fiction categories, as well as the fan orientated categories (fanwriter, fan cast, best related work). Those are the categories were the Hugo has the best chance of getting things right. 

The various media categories (dramatic presentation long & short, comics) are pointless because they don't venture beyond very mainstream tastes. 

The editorial categories are for the most part voted on by people with no clue what editors do (including myself) and therefore more an exercise in name recognition.

The fan and professional artist categories are handicapped by lack of interest and knowledge of sf/f artists and what work they've done this year. ","No, the major awards (Nebula, Clarke, BSFA, Tiptree) are of a similar usefulness (when nto gamed) as the Hugos.","If the Hugos are to be less American and more diverse, there need to be more non-American Worldcons.

I think there's a genuine desire there to see old-school 'entertaining' works nominated, and the organisers seem to genuinely believe good work that does not tick the ""liberals"" boxes is being overlooked. I think in the sense that being part of a scene can help being nominated - being one of the ""cool kids"" -- they could have a point. However, I have thoroughly enjoyed some of the winning and nominated Hugo authors in the past, so I personally disagree that the more literary and liberal works that have won are not entertaining. For instance, I loved Ancillary Justice. ","I find novels, novellas, movies, tv shows, semi-prozines and short stories interesting and of value. I read across the spectrum; never as much as I'd like to of anything. I'd love to see more Australian work considered. (Margo Lanagan, Seahearts anyone?)","I've found the British Kitschies awards a a great reflection of my taste. How could I not enjoy a Golden or Red Tentacle award? Every one of their recommendations I've read so far has been fabulous. International - yes. Jury judged.","I hope the Hugos survive this. Perhaps the nomination rules need to change to avoid the slates dominating. I think it would be sad to see any group dominate, but I enjoy having an award where the committed genre fans have a say, rather than just what is popular at the book store. 

I also hope the authors/magazines nominated this year are given a fair go and judged on their merit, especially those who were excited about their nominations and didn't realise it came on a slate at first. 

Kary English's story, ""Totaled"" is very good and worth a read. She is a liberal and kind person - I've met her online. I hate to think of her having to put up with all this crap. Likewise, Andromeda Spaceways Inflight Magazine is a magazine that deserves more attention, whether it wins a Hugo or not. As an Australian magazine, it may not have been nominated normally. It used to be reviewed by Tangent Online, but for some unknown reason, they stopped. With that lack of coverage, the magazine's profile probably fell.  I hope some good comes out of this and that more people read them. I'd love to see more Australian works included in the Hugos, but I do see them as primarily a US fandom award.","",""

I am so accustomed to feeling like I am human with full rights that when people who view me as a lesser creature surface, I am startled and depressed by it. The politics of the sad puppies are clear and they're vile. People like Vox Day would like to see me 'fixed' or dead.   

Considering those things, I would frankly rather see the end of the Hugos than see them become a soapbox for people who would not treat me as an equal human.

Trying to be politically correct and giving in to such notions only alienates the groups within fandoms and creates frictions.
I really wish Hugo Awards would have the approach of ""We don't really give a damn about who you are. We only care about great writing."", because as much as the Puppies manipulation disgusts me, so does the reaction of the part of the opposing community.

(As far as I know, a translated work never won in the novel category, for example. Things are changing - maybe the current year will be different (thanks to Liu Cixin).

Given the history of Worldcon itself, and the fact that it is mostly held in the USA, there is no surprise that even for authors writing in English, the American authors are dominant.

","We have to look at it on three different levels:

1. Are the winners reflect sf/f? No, one book couldn't represent a year.
2. Are the nominees a perfect selection? Agan, no - every year there are important works missing from the ballot, and there are works that are there - and you just don't understand why.
3. On the other hand, the best way to screen the (again, Anglophone) scene is to read the blogpost where bloggers and commenters try to list up their favourites (I am not talking about slates). On this level, before the nominations, but because of the Hugo Awards, the genre is well reflected.","No. Why should it?","While there are more and more people reading sf/f in English, most of the ""local"" fans rely on translations. Therefore the most important thing whether the publishers, editors see the Hugos as the quintessence of current SF/F. I'm sure that a nomination (and winning!) has a huge effect on a work's chance to be translated, but fortunately this is not the only factor.","Last year's experience tells me that I shouldn't expect much from a Puppy nominee. But I am ready to be surprised.

I do think that we shouldn't separate the two kind of Puppy litters, and that their action is shortsighted and on the long run, will work again them. 

They are a tiny part of the fandom, with a capability to wreck everyone else fun, but not big enough to represent all of us. 

I also do not think that there is a group that we could define as SP/RP opponents.

Graphic stories nominations have thus far been very boring and reflect so very little of the field, that obviously the general nominating crowd has little or no idea of what is interesting and worthy is the field.

I make use of the public library in these cases.","Yes.

It is not my fault that I make the effort to nominate and vote, while others who do NOT make that effort, sit back and complain. Or worst.

I do suspect that works by foreign authors (outside of North America) do NOT get as much recognition internationally at the Hugos as they properly deserve. This is a geographical barrier.","Yes. Out of the people I know who bother to nominate and vote.

Sadly, many fans are too scare to nominate and vote.

Many fans do not care.

Many think they do not read enough

Some fans do not trust their own judgement.

Some fans NEED someone important to tell them that this is good (this is where the problem of slate nominating comes into it)

Some get too precious about it to even try - like this sort of thing is too above / below them.

Weird as this may be, some fans cannot tell if it is good enough to be nominated, which flows back to the above things I have listed.

Lastly there is apathy. They support the awards in principle but do very little else.

I see and hear this in my own country and after seeing the 2015 Hugo mess, I suspect it is international as well","SP and RP do not represent me. I have already started reading their slate nominated works and they are very B-grade - not all, but most.

I paid for this opportunity with my Worldcon membership and I intend to use it. 

I just cannot understand the apathy of other WorldCon attendees who live locally, and have more chances than what I ever will have to nominate and vote.

I am disgusted by this voter apathy which has allowed slate voting to work. As fans we only have ourselves to blame. This occured in 2014 so we had some warning it was occuring but did people act to do something about it? More nominations would have reduce or stop the impact of slate voting. 

Most of what I am seeing is ""lets change the rules"". Few are saying ""lets get more fans nominating"". Possibly both are necessary, but any rules changes will take 2 years to take effect, if they change.

Surely as fans you must have some interest in some of the things on the Hugo ballot? Don't you want your favourite author to get some recognition ? The money may or may not be OK, so the only other thing left is the awards. I personally would want authors whose works I have enjoyed to get that industry recognition.

More nominations is the way to fix this, in my opinion.","",""

Also, the Locus awards split the Novel category into Best SF and Best Fantasy. I like this approach.

I also thought Eric Flint's ideas were worth considering. He posted something about the Hugo 2015 mess. I was reading his post and found this survey via File 770.

On the whole, the current format of the Hugos do reflect SF and F the way I see it.

I loved ""Red Shirts"" by John Scalzi. I read it in hardback when it first came out.  So did most of my book group. By the time it won the Hugo most of my book group had read it, liked it and fully approved of it winning the Hugo. 

A few members of my book group have already read one of this year's Hugo novel finalists way before the nominations were out. So Yes - the Hugos reflect SF/F as I see it. Other readers here in NZ like Ann Leckie's work too - both books, and are getting the 3rd book to read as well.","We have problems in my own country where very few fans make nominations.

Nominating and voting is a democratic process any fan who pays their money can do at Worldcon. A few exercise that right. Most do not (as we all now know thanks to the figures and the SP/RP slate). Some do not care. Some do not but then complain loudly at the outcome.

To answer your question - YES - out of the fans to do bother to read, nominate and vote.

I cannot answer for fans who do not nominate, vote or care. We have a lot of these here and it seems at Worldcon too.","How would you suggest getting into the head of some fan who could have nominated and voted, but did not out of their own choices, and then complains about the result ?","The SP and RP slates edged out most but not all of my nominations.

As I stated before - SP and RP do NOT represent fandom as I see it. No fan I know of would have such poor taste in reading. Their slate-nominated short fiction and novelettes are freely available on the internet. I have read them - I would not vote for some of these even if they appear on the ballot of my own country's SF/F awards. They are that bad, in some cases.","","I nominate and vote in my own country's SF and F awards. I would not describe these as ""more relevant"" but they are based on the Hugos, as many local SF/F awards are.

What the local awards have done is given me plenty of practise in nominating and voting. And identifying less than ideal works that should not get the vote.","The SP comes across as very poor losers. The SPs time would be better spent improving their writing skills, rather than organising slates and inventing conspiracy theories as to why they loose when it comes to Hugo awards.

The RP are just plain bad news. I hope they will not attend as some people will be very worried about their personal safety at Sasquan if they do attend.

No matter how much they say ""read these books, they are ONLY recommendations"", at this point, nobody has any illusions about what the Puppies are. They put out slates, they want their fans to vote for these slates as are, and thus this minority can shut out all the other voices in fandom. 

Personally, I feel slapped in the face. Almost nothing I nominated made it into the ballot - and I'm not talking osbcure choices, but really successful books that were deserving.

Works from lesser markets always have difficulty penetrating the main market.
The awards for shorter literary works have of late tended towards WRITERS stories rather than READERS stories. The proliferation of short fiction markets is a wonderful thing, but staying abreast of the field without an e-reader is impossible.
And Dr Who monopolised the short dramatic work, which was galling. Are there not any other TV shows?","I struggle to understand and form an opinion of the best editor categories, especially when one needs to be a sleuth to discern what editing the long form or short form editors have done.
Whereas there are no awards for best collected work: single author collection or multi-author collection.","Yes, to the preceding three questions. 
Timeliness of items has been a real problem.
Until the development of Amazon.com, Bookdepository and e-readers access to new works was haphazard and subject to intensive time delays.
The internet has also made access to the latest TV shows at lot easier.

The editor categories have generated the most discussion as to how to judge relative merit: as in who are these people and what did they bring to the party?

","The more I've read of the blogs and the like the more the SP camp comes across as sore losers or persons with atrophied tastes in SF/F. But there is a degree of validity to the chagrin expressed with the shorter fiction works developing a feel of WRITERS tastes over READERS tastes (sorry, unable to underline). Writers assess writing by different standards to readers. The 2014 short ""If you were a dinosaur"" is a good example: where was the genre content of this story? How did it get on the ballot with no genre content?

While I don't approve of slate based nominating and then voting, I can understand it. If I organise such a thing it's bound to be done in the best interests of the awards (all self-mockery intended).
However, organising the slate so that it fitted and filled the available spots in a category was reprehensible. Such an approach leads to screaming matches where the gist of the argument is ""only my opinion matters"".

Having read the SP suggested short works I have found this year's SP slate to be B grade at best. The purported aim was variety but the effect was a throwback to the writing standards and styles of the 1930s or early 1940s.
As for suggesting that the 16th work in a series (or any later work in a long series) is Hugo worthy, one really has to ask what makes this work so much better than a standalone or series starter? Has not the series become predictable and a somewhat paint by numbers now?

I found the RP written selection to be worse than B grade and representative of views that don't sit comfortably with me. (Not that I will decry a well written story expressing a viewpoint contrary to my own, but the RP choices were hamfisted in their delivery.) Mr Beale has a troop of sycophants - I noted no posts where his chorus expressed anything beyond a three word grunt of support.","The fiction written works - and probably the shorter forms more than the novel form.

If the Hugo administrator(s) were aware of the campaigns, and I would be surprised that the administrators were not made aware of the campaigns, then an absence of publicity regarding the campaign on the worldcon site or through mail outs was reprehensible.

It is also depressing that some of the mainstream press (The Guardian newspaper, for example) have written about the SP/RP issue, which gives a negative view of sf/f fandom to the wider world.

They don't represent fandom as I view it - fandom has always seems to be more inclusive and accepting to me. ","Yes, novels and the various story categories, followed by long form and short form dramatic presentations, are the categories I am most interested in. 

I don't read fanzines on a regular basis, and I don't listen to podcasts, so don't feel qualified to nominate or vote in those categories. The 'best editor' awards seem like they should belong in a 'professional' award rather than a 'fan' award. 

I know very little about sf/f art, so wouldn't nominate in this category (though I did vote on the basis that I could compare the nominated works).

Fan Writer and Fan Artist are unknown categories for me - as I'm not deeply involved in sf/f fandom I have no idea how someone would come to prominence in sf/f fandom and be nominated for these categories. ","No","I was surprised at the low number of people who nominated works for the Hugo awards in 2015. I went to Loncon3 in 2014 (first Worldcon), and was very pleased to be able to nominate works for the 2015 Hugos. There were over 5,000 people attending Loncon3 (according to the Member Demographics page), all of whom could have nominated works for the 2015 Hugos, plus the members of Sasquan, and MidAmeriCon II. The number of ballots received was only 2,122. Why are all these people who are enthusiastic enough to attend a Worldcon not bothering to nominate works for the Hugos? 

I know at least one person (my husband) didn't receive the email about nominating works (he didn't realise this until a few hours before the deadline, so wasn't able to nominate anything), but this couldn't have happened to everyone who didn't vote. ","",""

As American book market is the largest that uses the English language, naturally it's US-centric.","Yes, but English is my primary language.","No","Yes","It seems a bit Soviet-era Eastern European trade union, and frankly in-American. It devalues the award as the winners will have to live with the suspicion/doubt they didn't win on their own merits, but rather they were (or more likely the leading alternative) to slate-based voting. ","Much like the Oscars there are catagories where it's easy to identify a person's work, and other's where you only notice their work when they made a mistake.  Writing and editing are at the opposite ends of the spectrum.  Finishing a price of work it's easy to identify good writing, but rarely do I appreciate good editing. But it's easy to point at a work and see poor editing.
Also, I tend to like investing time in a story, so I tend to read novels over the shorter categories.","No","Ultimately slate voting will only cause problems in the short term. Anything that alienates the majority of the membership will be ostracised and rendered irrelevant after a couple of years.","",""
