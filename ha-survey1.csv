The fact that the puppies feel so unable to judge works from people who think differently to them and tell stories from that worldview that they are compelled to overrun the Hugos and try to bully fandom into such a narrow channel is saddening.

Also Worldcon is held more often in the United States with the nationality generally most represented being citizens of the USA. This drastically affects the nominations and voting. 

However, this is part of the award's character. Efforts to make it a genuinely world award are nice, but I suspect really for there to be an award that's representative and inclusive of all people then another serious award needs to be created which replaces the Hugo Award and has a less awful set of rules which bias the voting constituency against fiction that's not written both in the English language and published by publishing houses in the USA.","sometimes","I view the Puppies are a bunch of thugs who are demanding certainty in an uncertain world.

The first Worldcon was so named because it took place in New York, in 1939, and New York was simultaneously hosting the World's Fair. There was, so far as I know, no association between the two.

I presume though there was some notion of bringing the world of science fiction to New York's sf fans, and this developed into a convention that moved around the US, providing people with a chance to meet authors and one another. It seems like a very innocent endeavour, and I can imagine for them the world was North America and its developing fan groups, with some activity in the UK and no real idea what went on elsewhere. While they were doubtless shaped in part by an infant ideology of if it doesn't happen here, it doesn't happen anywhere else, they weren't really in a position to test that theory.(At some point someone needs to do a serious study of the effects of World War II on fan attitudes – not a history of who was where when but a proper sociohistorical study with grown-up theory in it.)

So,initially, 'world' does not mean world. At least, not like that. There are occasional forays beyond the North American continent (London, Heidelberg, Melbourne) but there's a sense that this is a treat for overseas fans, taking the show abroad once in a while. By the time I came along, there was a complex bid-zoning system for where in the US the convention could go by rotation, and when overseas bids could be submitted, and NASFICs for the years when the convention left North America (much of the zoning stuff seems to have died a death, presumably thanks to cheaper flights across the US). So it's clearly been positioned as a North American convention that goes abroad occasionally, not as a 'world', that is global, convention.

It is only comparatively recently that the emphasis on 'world' as 'global' has arisen, which I attribute to the many, many changes in the way the sf community perceives itself, its ability to keep in touch with people, different attitudes towards sf, all the stuff that's been rehearsed a hundred times across blogs and social media. And I think this is a very good thing. 

But only this week I've talked to people who thought that 'world' always meant 'global' and hadn't realised how the convention was originally named, which has clarified my puzzlement about their puzzlement.

What does this have to do with the Hugos?

The Hugos began as a one-off award given by one Worldcon. The following year's Worldcon didn't give them, but then Worldcons started to do it regularly and the association between the two became a legal one.To be a Worldcon, one of the things a convention must do is to agree to host and administer the Hugos. They were originally called Annual Science Fiction Achievement Awards until they officially became the Hugos. I suppose we might argue that they honoured the world of sf insofar as the voters understood it, which was a world in which sf was published in the US by mostly white men and some women. In other words, like most awards, they honoured the community  which gave them, and this supposed that there was one community. (I doubt there ever really was but like all dysfunctional communities they pull together for the year's big celebration.)

Worldcons have got bigger, as more people read sf and fantasy, and more people read a broader range of sf and fantasy, and critically, more people outside the Anglo-American axis read and write sf, but because the convention has been primarily tied to North America, I'm not sure these huge shifts in demographic have necessarily been reflected as immediately in Hugo nominating/voting patterns as it ought to have been. Indeed, it's been notoriously difficult to get an English novel or piece of non-fiction that isn't a zine onto a ballot. 

In part that would be because North Americans couldn't get hold of the UK material easily (whatever we might feel about Amazon et al it's amazingly easy to get a text these days) but equally, because it was incredibly difficult and expensive to send money abroad. International money orders were very expensive, very few UK people had US checking accounts, and credit cards had barely been invented, and weren't available to many ordinary people in the UK. I'm sure this is part of the reason why there has traditionally been a UK book blip in nominating patterns the year after a UK worldcon, because people had the power to nominate, and had been able to buy a voting membership too without having to deal with currency exchange (though Worldcons did, of course, eventually begin to have some foreign agents to deal with that – it would be interesting to see what the take-up was for that before the internet made everything easier). 

But even now, there have been recent years when I was just too broke to afford £25 to buy a supporting membership to vote (or maybe I didn't care enough to starve – who knows :-) ) And I'm probably not the only one. 

And in that the Hugo Awards reside within the Worldcon, which is still primarily a convention for North American fans, yes, I think it is primarily an American award. I'm not sure it intends to be, but if the award administration resides within a convention that is primarily a US convention, and is, or has been, primarily voted on by USians, with no mechanism for outreach, how can it be anything but primarily an American award? And to describe itself now as a 'world' award seems more risible than it did forty or fifty years ago, when it pretty much was. ","sometimes","They don't represent the fans I know best, but those I know best tend to be progressives rather than conservatives, so there is that to start with.

Then we need to separate Sad Puppies from the Rabid Puppies. 

The Sad Puppies seem to me to represent a group of mainly men who hanker after the lost golden age of twelve in a Ray Bradbury novel, when they were the centres of their own personal universes, and sex, work, and people not adoring their awesomeness was not an issue. They seem to be drawn to every marker of masculinity you can think of so I imagine the modern world must come as something of a shock to them. Particularly the bits about being called out for the way they refer to women, homosexuals, other ethnicities, and pretty much anyone who isn't a white cishet gun-toting man's man like them. 

(Excuse my sarscasm. Actually, don't.)

But there are Sad Puppies and Sad Puppies, i.e the people who the Sad  Puppies have determined share their values because their fiction implies they might do.  So, on top of all their other crimes, there is a failure to distinguish fiction from real life,and to separate author from text.

More seriously, I think the actual Sad Puppies seem to be symptomatic of a broader social movement of men who have discovered that the world doesn't revolve round them and are not very good at figuring out why this might be and how best to deal with it,and can't shut up about how much it hurts. They're all 'I could have been a contender', or that difficult uncle who turns up at Christmas to whine about not having had the breaks, and haven't noticed that if they cleaned up their acts, they still could be contenders, though I still wouldn't vote for the kind of stuff they write because it's dull and old-fashioned. But lots of people do like what they write; they just liked what someone else wrote better when Correia didn't win the Campbell. This is the big problem. They're dealing in absolutes (because they're twelve) rather than in gradations, like grown-ups. 

The Rabid Puppies – and here I mean Theodore Beale and, yes, John C Wright, because I regard him as much more dangerous than the likes of Correia and Torgerson – are a whole different thing. Beale is utterly detestable but much more politically savvy than the likes of LC and BT (as witnessed by their getting him involved in the first place). And much the same could be said of JCW.

The Sad Puppies sort of emerge from a line of jolly fannish japes, like buying a voting membership for your pet rock, even though they were hamfisted in trying to turn the Hugos back to real fiction by real men (i.e.the stuff they write) but the RPs seem to me to be simply using the Hugos as but one more arena for a much more fundamental disagreement with society about their position, or lack of position, in it. It is really all about white male supremacy, and the Hugos just turn out to be collateral damage this year, and probably in years to come.

In many respects, the biggest problem the sf community has got is that it is trying to Save the Hugos when it could be using its considerable energy to campaign about things like black teenagers getting shot, the erosion of women's reproductive rights, diversity issues, combatting the MRA movement, and using sf texts to illustrate their arguments rather than trying to preserve the non-existent sanctity of an award because  … tradition. 

This is not to say that many fine people do not devote time to these issues as well as trying to Save the Hugos, but the Hugos are not going to be saved like that. They've lost their innocence, insofar as they ever had any (which is of course the point the SPs were in their cackhanded fashion making, and they were up to a point correct) so better to think about what to do in future, bearing in mind the ridiculous restrictions round trying to make any changes, and stop fretting about reclothing the Hugos in virginal white. 

Having said that, the Save the Hugos faction does indeed represent the kind of fandom I know. Very well-meaning, sometimes almost child-like in its desire to do the right thing, heavily vested in its history and traditions, basically good-hearted but sometimes very unworldly. And unfortunately, the world has come to them.

I can't imagine that we'll ever be able to go back to the happy, prelapsarian world where people good-naturedly campaigned for their mates and David Gerrold could win a Hugo for a frankly execrable story because it was all about his adopted son and … ah!!!

In a way, I'm not sure I want to. On the other hand, I can see that for many people it's a hell of a shock to move from that to something akin to neo-Nazis demanding you vote for a slate that has been carefully selected for its literary purity, with nothing in between.

Their contention, for example, that speculative fiction is becoming politicised and that it wasn't before makes me wonder which alternative universe  they've been inhabiting. The best SF, from writers they seem to revere, was always political.  The genre has always been used to enable discussion of political issues, as evidenced by writing from the McCarthy era.

","A. I believe Sad Puppies 1 and 2 demonstrated that the Hugo process was fairly followed based on the number of people involved.  It also demonstrated that a vocal (hopefully small) portion of the small number of people voting/nominating were not open to new external people joining the Hugo nominating/voting process.

B. I am ashamed of the histrionics of the vocal (again hopefully small) portion of the Hugo awards that demanded the presenter resign because he may tell a joke that may offend people.  This was censorship at it's worst since it is based on a possibility not an actuality.

C. Promotion of works eligible for the Hugo award have existed for a long time, likely as long as the awards have.  I see no difference between individual work promotion and a recommended reading list and a slate to garner attention to particular works.  A vote is a vote is a vote and to think otherwise is a move away from democratic principles.  

D. Assuming Larry C, Brad T speak for Sad Puppies and Teresa NH and Patrick NH speak for the anti-Sad Puppies and ignoring the vocal minority supporting each side as best as I can.  I see one side consistently saying here are works I liked, read the works and vote for the ones you like.  I see the other side saying the Hugo awards this year need an asterisk indicating the wrong stories have been nominated at best, or declaring no award without reading the works at worst.  And in the prior year saying see told you that your stories were not good enough for an award.  One side seems more like a baby saying ""nyah-nyah I was right"" last year and taking their ball and going home this year, which is not a behaviour I encourage in anyone assumed to be an adult.  

E. I expect the vast majority of fandom doesn't give a hoot about the Hugo awards or this controversy.

F. I expect the majority of the minority of fandom that knows about the Hugo awards controversy would vote a pox on both their houses if that's what it takes to get everyone to just shut up about it so they could get back to talking/doing things that interest them (such as tricks to making a good costume).

G. The small minority of fandom that is involved in Sad Puppies or the opposition to it have hardened their positions and appear not to be willing to converse/accomodate/compromise with the other side.

1) It is voted during Worldcon which is primarily American convention where most of attendees is from US (even when it is held in Europe)
2) There is not enough translation into English what means that Hugo is chosen mainly between works that were originally published in English and American market is certainly one of the biggest English markets.","sometimes
","I do believe it strongly varies from person to person. In both camps there are people who seem to be members of fandom and wanting only good for the award. Still at least some of the people who seem to be interested rather in fight than in fandom. We should not consider SP/RP poponents/oponents as two homogenous groups.
As for my view on the controversy I am definiteley against slate-based voting it kills the whole idea of the award. I do believe that Brad Torgersen did a thing he believes was good. As for Larry Correia I do believe he knew that what he is doing is bad but he wanted to prove something. Vox Day seem to be a person who is doing everything only for him and against other people.",4,""

","The more I've read of the blogs and the like the more the SP camp comes across as sore losers or persons with atrophied tastes in SF/F. But there is a degree of validity to the chagrin expressed with the shorter fiction works developing a feel of WRITERS tastes over READERS tastes (sorry, unable to underline). Writers assess writing by different standards to readers. The 2014 short ""If you were a dinosaur"" is a good example: where was the genre content of this story? How did it get on the ballot with no genre content?

While I don't approve of slate based nominating and then voting, I can understand it. If I organise such a thing it's bound to be done in the best interests of the awards (all self-mockery intended).
However, organising the slate so that it fitted and filled the available spots in a category was reprehensible. Such an approach leads to screaming matches where the gist of the argument is ""only my opinion matters"".

Having read the SP suggested short works I have found this year's SP slate to be B grade at best. The purported aim was variety but the effect was a throwback to the writing standards and styles of the 1930s or early 1940s.
As for suggesting that the 16th work in a series (or any later work in a long series) is Hugo worthy, one really has to ask what makes this work so much better than a standalone or series starter? Has not the series become predictable and a somewhat paint by numbers now?

I found the RP written selection to be worse than B grade and representative of views that don't sit comfortably with me. (Not that I will decry a well written story expressing a viewpoint contrary to my own, but the RP choices were hamfisted in their delivery.) Mr Beale has a troop of sycophants - I noted no posts where his chorus expressed anything beyond a three word grunt of support.",4,"noresponse"

That is not strange, considering that English is lingua franca of Science-Fiction and that everybody reads anglo - saxon SF, either in english or translations. 

There are mayn reasons for it, but SF from other languages simply does not have penetration to get Hugo. if it does have numbner of readers, those readers do not nominate and vote for Hugos...","no


","This is even smaller fraction than before, and it is result of politics permeating various levels of society, including the SFWA.

In my opinion, current ""politicaly correct etc"" group that has majority in SFWA is sometimes taking things into extreme, causing childish reactions from other side that can't cope with changes. At least Sad puppies were tryingto be inclusive, and many works they considered in previous years were not badto read.
However, Rabid puppies and Vox Day took big dump into all of it and ruined thae day.

","As an outsider it seems to reflect the reactionary mindset of the right or Republican party. I first started following the kerfuffle with limited interest but that changed rapidly when some of the Rabid puppies, Kratman and Day stated that they would like to see the Hugo’s destroyed. Essentially acting like a petulant child threating to dismantle a Lego fortress because you aren’t playing with it correctly. 
Slate voting is a cop out and a sublimation of someone’s individual opinions to a greater group for the express purpose ensuring the “right” works are rewarded. I have no problem with recommend reading lists on the other hand since one is free to vote for  the best works as one sees it.

 To me the RP/SP obviously represent a portion of  fandom  because they are SF and Fantasy fans as well. That said they have managed to make fandom into a microcosm of American politics which is sad since this is supposed to be a hobby and fun!!! Now every potential Hugo nominee will not only be judged by its intrinsic work but whether it satisfies a political litmus test. The puppies unfortunately created this mind set and reading puppy approved works one now is on the lookout, assuming one is not a puppy, for their philosophy to creep up in a story and when it does the natural reaction is to judge it more harshly. They have made the whole process confrontational while claiming the role of the victims despite the fact that they are the instigators.

","It's depressing to realise people have such a negative view of sf/f that is not 'Straight White Male'. I will be honest and say it seems to be a very American issue (not that the UK doesn't have a share of right-wing bigots). It is also depressing that some of the mainstream press (The Guardian newspaper, for example) have written about the SP/RP issue, which gives a negative view of sf/f fandom to the wider world.

They don't represent fandom as I view it - fandom has always seems to be more inclusive and accepting to me. ",4,"no"
